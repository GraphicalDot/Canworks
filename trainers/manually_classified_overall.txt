Hot Millions has been a favourite ever since we were in School .They ' re well worth it and are an important part of Chandigarh ' s culinary history !Domino ' s is no longer a good choice .ok types not very good.Awesome place compared to all the other places in adarsh nagar , raja parkOoo Nostalgic : ) It ' s been one of the places I have been hanging out to eat since childhood .I have enjoyed a lot dere .You must try thismany preferits a nice place ....n it was a delight ...recomended from my side ...Very cozy location on gerri route...Surely its super hit as every pizza outlet in d town copies dem......I will never visit this place again .Overall bad experience .Better go to mainland china or barbeque nation in 26 sector .However when I visited the Beltola joint , I was amazed .It is a small joint and during lunch hours had to wait to get a table .been there twice ....go there on a warm wintery afternoon ..go there on a warm wintery afternoon ..it has been my pet family resturant for around 10 years .thats disappointing .Great job , keep going strong !i went to this place on the first day of new year 2014 .and i was very much relieved to say that i wasnt disappointed .kudos !the place was proper and spic n span and i really enjoyed my meal there ...but sometimes in weekends and festive seasons it'll be a bit hard for someone to find a seat as it is packed with customers .the first resort in Ghy which i had visited the first time some 6 - 7 years back !though it's a little away from the city , what you get to see there is quite satisfying ...I have been to tao last time for a party .This is the second time i visited Crackling Mustard and like always i was not at all disappointed .Overall another very good experience .Highly recommended .It brings back the feeling of a bengali restaurant .awesome ..hopefuly dis was our last visit to dis place .a big crossI don ' t recommend going to Park Prime .must try ..i have visited Pizza Hut hell lot of times ...Food , Friends and Drinks ....Would visit again .You may choose other place but for a normal hangout with friends , its good .i don't think one can ask for more from a restaurant !Simply try it man and you will love itbut can get crowded and noisy .their standards have sadly gone downwhich disappointed me ...it was a very bad experience altogether ...we had a very awful experience ..would never like to visit this place again neither will recommend others to visit this place ....But yes it was not upto the mark as expected at this kind of property .should increase the capacityotherwise awesomei didn't enjoy it at all .i loved it so much its a must try you can always find the place full .no other pizza outlet in Guwahati stands a chance against it .brands " the largest fast food chain in the world , Pizza Hut is a renowned venture across the globe and it has definitely caught some attention in town already .i am not too fond of domino's pizzas .I didnt liked this kfc muchFantastic ...too less seating capacity being just around 300 metres away from my place , i thought of trying it out once .i think it would be a safe choice to skip this place .boring ..It is indeed one of the best clubs in chandigarh .My all time favourite .We make it a point to visit this little place whenever we are near Latasil .A must visit a much better place would be Quick Pick and Chung fa if u looking at good chinese at reasonable rates .This is one classy joint .Give it a try .Nice place .and since we happened there around 2 in the afternoon so wasn't crowded too .and since we happened there around 2 in the afternoon so wasn't crowded too .good a must try in Guwahati Overall : a 3 out of 5.Still , it is one of those restaurants one should visit ( even if only once ) in the city ....however this particular loyan's has an added option of sitting and eating , and the area is quite clean so more brownie points for that !however this particular loyan's has an added option of sitting and eating , and the area is quite clean so more brownie points for that !Cool but perhaps not the single best .jus simply 'ok' ...would suffice for it , cause the place failed to live up to my expectation .Itz good i would ask anyone who is reading this not to visit that bar .Worst place to visit if u r with cousin .Drizzle was great place to relax during the week end .Dominos Vaishali !And thankfully no under age doings happen here as they are very strict about checking IDs right at the entrance .It can be rented out for exclusive private parties and corporate get - togethers also which is a plus !Do drop by for a ' let down your hair evening ' ..This might be the next hip party place soon .Area 51 used to one of the premium party place few years back .Now this place has lost its charm .Its open till 1 am while other party places are open till 2 am .The only worst part I could find is crowd .I had a great experience .It was good .Recommended only if ur not in for dominoes / Pizza Hut .Recommended only if ur not in for dominoes / Pizza Hut .- excellent.- excellent .lot desirable as far as maintenance is concerned ....lot desirable as far as maintenance is concerned ....washroom stinks , mosquitoes and even flies .....Good place .doesn't have anything special to pen down !good for just turned 21 people !its a good place for the younger lot !Take my advice ; visit the place once in a month so that you don ' t get bored .Brilliant place .I went to this place with a bunch of my friends on a weekend during its first month of inauguration .Apart from this , they have these small contests like drink 6 shot glasses of beer with a straw in 20 seconds and get a beer for free .Fun place .I will definitely return .the first restaurant in Guwahati for me and certainly as told by others it has great Chinese and Thai food .but for hangouts it's a nice option Loved it !not a single mistake done .best part u can reach her at 1 am n still get a table , bt after waiting in d que ..If youre in Jaipur and are looking for a nice place to dine , you got to visit the terrace grill .infact a great place to spend a nice winter evening This is the place to be Basically , a total chilling - out - place to be .Air Lounge is the perfect place to unwind .love this place !a great place to hang out with friends or loved ones .decent crowds , safe place and its got this at home vibe .One of the best in town .i wish it could be a little more fine dining But if you are going there with your family or with your girlfriend please avoid it .I guess they have two different sections one for food and the other for liquor and sheesha .And a wonderful experience all together for a disabled person .den nandos is d perfect place to be dere ..good place to go ...Loved the over all experience .i was disappointed in both regards .Excellent Experience ?Great place to be with your special ones .Keep it up guys overall it was a fair experience .very disappointed not aware that only couples allowed .the only thing that will make u irritate is the long waiting list ....Once it was a favourite place for our group .this Is a Kind Of Restaurant For Which It Can Be Rightly Said That The Packaging Is Worth More Than The Actual Product Itself .kentucky Fried Chicken is probably the most popular fast food chain in the city .It could be better You will have a very good evening with friends not much to say bout it but not - it is modified and looks disaster .totally crowded place and not even clean at all .This is just the place .A good place when you want to relax and have a quiet dinner..Maybe that should give you an idea how bad a place can be .What a disaster .Overall an horrible experience .One of the best restaurants in kolkata ." But trust me this restaurant is a class apart .Looking foreward to my next visit here .absolutely amazing .amazing Flip side : the restaurant turn into a club on week ends , the two bar counter are always crowded so getting a drink is kind of tough .Club : one of the most happening clubs of Chennai .Flip side : the restaurant turn into a club on week ends , the two bar counter are always crowded so getting a drink is kind of tough .Flip side : the restaurant turn into a club on week ends , the two bar counter are always crowded so getting a drink is kind of tough .Absolutely loved our experience .One of those restaurants you save the 5 * for.worth it Will go back again which was really nice no doubt ...Exquisite and awesome ....Did not find any girls in this place and tharkey type men looming around .I will rate this outlet at 5 / 5 - because of its consistent quality right across , which is unusual in such multi - fare outlets ...Loyans , got to know about it from zomato itself and finally got a chance to taste it ..Starting with the location its a bit out of commercial place but still accessible ..Thumps up from my side .i think its overrated .gulati , serves great .i went all the way from New Alipore to Barrackpore by road to this well reviewed Dada Boudi Hotel the eatery has got two portions - the outside one is small & amp ; too drab with attached washbasins at one corner .The place looks a normal food joint with multiple decks to choose from .Boasted as the ' haldirams ' of Jaipur , I chose to visit this place with my family for dinner .The place looks a normal food joint with multiple decks to choose from .I always make it a point that I visit Hot Millions when ever I visit the city beautiful Chandigarh..Would not recommend the place .If there was ever a restaurant that was aptly named , it was definitely this one .Believe me , better is coming .I would visit this place again and again just so that I can taste every single thing on the menu Unsure why this place is trending in the top list .Nothing really special apart from a regular bar .Disappointed i love it soo muchhh ......thought u have to wait for 1 hour to eat in it , i also did it .....but actually it is worth it congratulations .One of the best place to hangout late night .it was on a weekday that we visited them and i was surprised to see the crowd .I didn ' t see the hype that reinforces Loyans .i guess its run by jains which makes it jain friendly too its close proximity to the Barrackpore station is a big plus point .this pizza hut is big and spacious compared to some other franchises around the country .after a grand feast i realised the reason why they are so famous and pull in somuch crowd .you just cannot have enough of this .it is out of the way from mainstream Kolkata so not a first choice .small little place it is a small joint Air is sure one of the best lounges in city .Air is huge , spacious .A true savious for people working in the night shifts or friends getting together for drinks at night .I went to this place reading its reviews over zomato , and trust me every word turned out to be true .Must go for everyone .Good job that felt like Royal Its an awesome concept .heard much about it and today i was there for the first time .a worth going place .will visit again Thumps up from my side .i'd say it is good .i am not sure if thats happened to everyone or its just the fault in my stars , both the times i'd been there , the place was choked by loud and volumous diners ; just enough to ruin the entire atmosphere .Visited this place on basis of reviews .Oh great place for a fantastic dinner .Very much appreciated .Surely recommend this place for a good dinner .Loved them all .it was fab Very very good ...good place to hang out .It seems more like they are trying to bank on the idea of a restaurant that is open at 4am in the morning .i can die for it .its quite an off - route place as well .accomodation is the major drawback of this joint .its quite an off - route place as well .but the waiting is what will kill u total disaster ..! the best part of this joint is their opening hours .the long waiting .amazing place ..great job guys ..u guys have a fantastic thing going here .keep it up ..Worth a try What a place And I have always stepped out satisfied with this place .0D is more like a picnic spot for teenagers .i love this place just because i love it just step out of the local railway station and the first shop you see with a huge line in front of it is a very small and cosy hotel with no ac and frankly , hot inside , nice to see dada - boudi here ...only suggestion due to paucity of space better enjoy with family at own place ...which was absolutely amazing .this is not a typical place for sit down meal .This place is just amazing and I ' m a H U G E fan Absolutely in love with this place it Might Be a Small Place And Unhygenic , Well Talking About Hygine i Must Mention Those Certain Times When We Say " let's Have Fuchka although it's Small The experience was excellent .all in all this makes a must visit food joint reccomended by me .lil did we know that this place would grow up to be one of jaipu's elite restaurant ...i suggest to go there at lunch ..double thumbs up to them for that .One of the best places for group gatherings and parties Good place to be ; - ) amazing experience ..big thumbs up i love dis place I had to throw a party to some very close friends and was looking for options , due to weekend was not able to find a confirmed place in Forresta and suddenly someone suggested this place .A must visit place Decent place .But something I didn ' t like was the fact that it charges an entry , not a cover..Overall , nice place to chill out .but not what i expected .its totally worth visiting .My only complaint is that they just have 2 outlets and that is kinda a let down if you dont live in either Malad or Andheri .waiting kills u ...Joey ' s special was the best Nothing special .I like this place a lot .Excellent place ...So go to boveda and make that sat night special.Have been to this place many times .Used to be good .there's usually a waiting time of at least 15 - 20 mins , especially during weekends .love it  the happy hours are cherry on the top .Really " feel good " as its tag line .have heard so much about this place so while on Zomato decided to visit this as well ...amazing Cheers ..luvv it .Perfect place for a romantic dinner .Overall , a place worth a one - time visit .joey's was on my to - visit list since months now .lovely place and best new club in the city.comfortable , relaxing and enjoyable .every saturday air is the right choice : ) it's an experience So overall a satisfactory experience ( y ) A visit to this place is suggested .6 people and has table tops for people who wanna enjoy a drink or two and just have fun .good Place ...loved it to the core ..highly recommended ..a must visit place to hangout with friends and family too we went for our office party at q'ba as suggested by colleagues ..recommended.Hope to visit again .Will visit again .you ll always find this place crowded ...Quite good ?Been here loads and loads of times .If you wannaa get over Dominos smokins , this is the place to go .though the place is very small , congested i like q'ba Overall it was a nice experience Visited the restaurant yesterday with family over dinner .Such a horrible experience .But will neither recommend this restaurant nor visit ever again .A nice place to hangout with ur friends .better food , better service and people smiling all around .Will definitely recommend .do not understand why public so gaga .This place used to be good , now it ' s horrible ( Sorry for being harsh ) .the occasion was special and so was the diner .over all a wonderful experience ( It was an amazing experience coming to this place .air Cafe Lounge looks set to appeal to shoppers looking to relax , office workers and those who enjoy interesting food in comfortable and informal surroundings .with good local parking , Air Cafe Lounge would also make an attractive location for private parties and events .in no time it has became hyd's Best and most preferred Lounge ..air Cafe Lounge at Jublee Hills .in No Time Air Cafe Lounge turns out to be city's Best Brand ...This place is just too good .Awesome place Its a nice and warm place to be Nice place to be Good place to visit .always preferrable for take - away rather to dine in .A place for Bengali food loves and even those who do not like it much are also sure to fall in love with it .I love this place everytime in a new way I visit here .This is a favourite one of mine .I recommend this to all to please come and try it .Nothing special about it .Its a Bar cum Restaurant .Hi All , One of the finest place to hangout with your friends .You ll just love to be here .Wow Loved it .And you can spend the time as long as you can .personally felt great being here .Awesome place ..one of the must go places in jaipur gulati is a very popular restaurent .nice family restaurent .but always crouded .its hard to find place .You have to visit This is the right choice .Nice choice for great occasions .have heard lot of abt dis place ...nd its amazing place ...its hard to be in dis industry wid old name ...but it did not disappoint u ..alimentos , the place has a very delusioned feel to it.overall i was satisfied and happy .It was a great experience overall .Overhyped We were here today celebrating a friends birthday .If i have to sum it up it was an average experiance for me .the very famous shiv Sagar fr mumbai is now in ahmedabad .must try a very good experience When reaching there i manage to get a table for 4 after waiting for 10 mins .So i guess its better to walking then call them .Do try it .have heard that this place is almost 20 to 25 yrs old Good .One of my all time favourite restaurants in jaipur .It has always been a good hang out place where we can go without a second thought .i have been quite a few times to this place .its huge and have this hall where you can arrange private parties .You know instead of all this , the best advice is Just don ' t bother going here , it a total mess .Shiv Sagar is simply great .Recommended .Visited there for first time .waiting time is a turn off :( go early get seats Cool place to be wish they had more outlets in Mumbai Love this place .No doubt the best .This place is disgusting Do not go here The only thing that I did not like was the 1 week wait to get a table due to their small restaurant .Thank you for the amazing experience Ond hell of a place Disappointing : - ( This made me think twice before going in to this place on a Saturday night and had to back off .This is officially my fav .good for nothing place ..unnecassary hyped ..i can't understand why people are rating it even 2 .fully faltu.very unhygienic .!Give dis place a chance ...hav a feel good feelin inside u as well ...nd u won ' t have nything to regret...Place is very nice to chill out with friends making it perfect for students .what more can you ask for :small place ..Has a good vibe going all the time dont miss t everything - be it the service , interiors or food is impeccable .A good place for friends and family outing .Gulati is an iconic name in Delhi ' s traditional eating circles and has maintained its connoisseurs .Recommended for sure .limited amazing felt lavish  Nothing is better than this place on a Sunday evening .Getting inside and getting a seat is a tough job .we went there on a saturday night and the whole market had a good buzz with many people around .we had a 15 minute waiting time but honestly it was well worth it .Location : Statue Circle .Doesn ' t get better than that Parking is a major headache during weekends .Parking is a major headache during weekends .To be precise , I would sum up my experience at this place to be pleasant .One of the oldest famous resturant situated at pandara road ...a den for late night family outings since our childhood .good I would rather hop over to CP to grab something better ( atleast a better view ) ....overall a good experience ...overall a good experience True to it ' s name , Little Italy offers you everything you can possibly expect at an Italian restaurant .It seems nice to see that they want you to have a good time as much as you want to the place seems gud , entered der with a gr8 exceptation but got a lil disappointed amazing place to be .......all in all a very nice experience .I would like to suggest that people should prefer to go for Night Owl instead of Batman .I would like to suggest that people should prefer to go for Night Owl instead of Batman .Highly disappointed with the feedbacks of appreciations we read from the feedbacks provided they might be friends of Batman .The biggest lounge cum hookah place i saw here .nice time pass but it more than makes up with the experience .if you haven't been there yet , a definite must - visit for dinner .This was my third visit to Koyla and after a long time .Getting up to the restaurant is a task though .You have to take stairs up as there is long queue for the lift or its not working .They should definitely do something about it .I have been to Sigree in powai as part of corporate culture .I wanted to take my parents out for dinner here and we chose to reach here for my aunt ' s birthday .Everything was perfect .Apart from this everything was picture perfect .A Friday night outing here will ensure a cool start to the weekend .some things never change ...Definitely worth a try .though can improve .A must visited place in pune i went to Shanghai Salsa on my friend's recommendation and it didn't disappointed me .Walked in on a Friday night to find the place bustling with people all ready to get their drink on ....the place is huge and was open till 3 am that night .it was very good it seems a restaurant where many tourists and expats go , this is a very large place .Gud , nice place to relax One of the worst experiences i have had since the time i started visiting resturants .This is one of the rare restaurants , where thr is waiting even on weekdays , that ' s what happened with us as well .But let me put it straight , it is worth the wait .There are reasons why this one stands tall since 1959 , they have kept the standard intact .Went with my uncle who has been regular visitor since 30 years .He said he has never been disappointed here , and my uncle has travelled extensively all over the world .Just enjoy n let me know your experiences Disappointment 10d one awesome place to party with frnds and ur loved ones ...went for retro night Friday ...simply awesome must try A quaint little place just adjacent to lodhi gardens .this is my second visit to delhi's most famous restaurant Gulati and trust me its awesome in all respects .overall very nice experience .it is recommended especially for families because outside you will find all over families waiting for their turn to enter in restaurant .:to avoid waiting please visit around 8 to 830 pm because after that there is long waiting of 1 or 2 hours majorly in weekends .In short worthless ...Nothing great .A superbly rocking place in Pune .A must try party place in Pune : ) And the crowd was super charged .It should be interesting to visit this place again when it ' s nini ' s kitchen .firstly i must say it's not a sit and dine place .been here twice in one day after i got my first salary .overall a must visit place .I have been a regular customer of this place since 2001 .Seeing the high rating like 4.4 on zomato , I and my fried went to this place with very high expectations .Rest all was very much unexpected and weird .Location is kinda crappy .First impression - its a great place .Tried this sigree first time .the best a Must try purely awesome It was a bad experience with replay as always .The chain in Bombay matches it standards all over the world .had a really nice time ...Wouldn ' t suggest it to anyone .Great place , always full of energy We travel all the way from gurgaon just to have it .The expectation was really high after seeing the photos of the place and food .but the downside is , it was pretty chilly and windy and they should've had some heaters put in some corners .considering this was being touted as bbq nation's competition , we went there with really high expectations .but no , we were utterly disappointed .An awesome place to be .Thanks to Mr.Thanks for a memorable experience .Went to this place for dinner .Had done a reservation for 3 arnd 7pmCame to know after reaching the place dat kids are not allowed .They allowed us after a long wait ...was utter shit .The bill these 3 things came to around 1.2kPeople with kids avoid this place and Jain ppl this place is not for you ' llThis place is only for drinks and not for food .Rude lounge was much much better ...I miss that place so much .N I had a horrible time dnt care abt others if they had a good time as this is my personal experience .full Marks .......had a real good time .!But yes , it ' s an ideal place for a romantic evening .a good place to hangout .Definitely a place on the to - go list .All smiles .Overall , a nice place if you ' re looking for a relaxing evening and some conversion .Will definitely go back again definitely the best place Best Lounge Of Chandigarh We went there on a weekday fearing the rush on weekends only to find the restaurant packed anyways .We finally got our table 30 min later .The place is predictably noisy as the Delhi families feel completely at home over here .loved it ...Was looking to get more out of the experience .that's a down side .Average .must visit .Thank you .but the setting of the entire place is what makes me rate it this way .Perfect place to go for a get together .located at 2 mins walking distance from Barrackpore Station .but space for dine in is congested and a long queue would be found on ocassions such as new year or christmas .as for my experience , i loved it but when we got there , we pleaded to give us a table inside cause it was too cold for me .Nice place in the heart of Delhi .All in all a good place .i always wanted a place where one could sit out and enjoy Delhi , and qba is an amazing relaxing place.everthing is amazing abt this place Horrible night , worst experience in Pune .We were here on of our early dates in delhi and had a superb experience !Recommended to visit with special person and special occasions but it's one of the best places around .but nevertheless worth it .Yes , definitely .Amazing place ..would love to visit again .The downside of this restaurant is that there is too much waiting time , but I find it all worth after finishing the meal..Go for it people .awesome but overall it's amazing .Awsm so probably one can conclude it ' s not a day place .Worth a try What more could I have asked for Awesome place One of the finest longues....was made a cherishable memory ..which was awsummm ..i gently reminded him that this is a fine dining facility , not a discotheque .Love it ..This place is awesome...m goin wid a generous 3 / 5 for dis place , good but not enough.nice place to get together and have dinner in the centre of Delhi ..and i must say ice lounge is well deserved .I would thoroughly recommend ICE LOUNGE to anyone with a sweet tooth .I know I ' ll certainly be returning soon .!must go place .The minute I stepped into this place , I felt like I was back in a Goa shack .The place is so welcoming and relaxing , you don ' t feel like getting out .Ever since the first time I went there , Tropical lounge has become my favorite .I ' d recommend this place over any other joint in Jaipur .If a classy romantic date night is on your list , this is the perfect dine - out for you .An ideal family restaurant where one can come in big groups to chat and enjoy food .The bottom line is that gulati restaurant deserves a visit .very nice place .gives you separate areas for bar and dining .must try .Urban Asia is truly a brilliant dining experience .The place was packed when we entered but we chose to take seats by the bar .I was amazed at the attention to detail .We then were invited back to the bar , had a drink with the owner and ended up having a fabulous evening with filled with great conversation .There might be many Asian restaurants in the city , but I would come back again to this one for how special my dining experience was .And the location prime .All in all a good experience its a very fine fine - dining restaurant .i like them .i will definitely try it again .First of its kind .a new place came up silently and gained points .so thumbs up with recommendations .Excellent Excellent .Must try place .One place I would always suggest to my cousins or friends from abroad is aer...super place worth every penny .of course they should really do something about the space issues .Gud deals are available awesome experience .....you start with long waiting time outside , but its worth it .....the must have's are a worth going place ....On the whole you will have a great experience here .Overall a great experience .Luved it The place is located at safdarjung enclave and is its main attraction .I have been there for few times and it never gave me any complains .The place has its own life .By this I mean that the vibrance of the place especially after dusk its something else It was time for a family lunch and so this place was chosen .This place in salt lake city centre was unknown to me a few years back but friends of mine suggested it to be quite something .In spite of that , a great place its a small and old place ..but truly speaking was a little disappointed...could have been better .A must visit again .Awesome place to hangout had a great evening and liked every bit here .overall a must go place .Will go back to this place everytime i go bangalore Worth a visit..Great Location ....Below Average .cozy little place .good for a quiet dinner .Overall it ' s a total package .I loved it .Overall lacks on the basics .a bit messy classyyy Amazing place ...We visited this restaurant on a Saturday eve with our friends .Had our office party here & amp ; it was fabulous .Had an Amazing experience guys We had gone there for a team party .Juzz awsum Been there many times with ma uncle and again I go back for more Keep it up guyzz Delightful every time .A must the entry was quite deceptive since the place is really spacious overall , great place and i intend to go there again pretty soon There aren ' t any words to describe .I had a mesmerizing experience .It has been a long time that I had wanted to try this place .U would love to go and try more of it .Smokin ' Joes is the only one that can come close but is still 2nd best .The wait is worth it .I had been with my family on my b ' day and had very bad experience .I can ' t suggest the place to anyone ...nando's for me is a personal favorite ...Awesome place enjoyed too much with friends.An overhyped place .Gulati is the classic old place on Pandara Road that has withstood the test of time .Being around for such a long time isn ' t easy .Restaurants come and restaurants go but this one has managed to stay for a long long time .I think that is what keeps a restaurant alive .It came out with flying colors .And my adda these days .Had heard a lot about this place , thanks to zomato and a couple of friends .but for now its a big no to vist your place sorry I would have waited another hour to eat here .What the heck.......Nyc place to go wid frnds im definitely going back again : ) The place is amazing one of the best places Must visit Dont go with high expectations to high .Go here Team is so happy to be there and will be visiting soon once again .This is a place to be surely visited once you are in guwahati Try Gulati .You hv decent sitting soace so can go with family too .Over hyped Nice everything fine .It is one of the best restaurants I have been to in long time .I would really like to visit this place again .Ya it is a good place But they are missing something .just amazing..Thanks alot ?We went on our wedding anniversary and it was probably the best decision .Loved the food , ambience , service and decor .Would love to visit again sometime for a dinner .A perfect place that suites every occasion .Firstly what a place this place is ideal for all kind of people ...been to this place many times and get good response from the people there ...All in all a good hang out for youngsters .Keep it up and nice work I took my friend there for my birthday .Overall it was a great experience .I really enjoyed there .it ' s a great place to hang out with your friends Worst experience ever Hard Rock Cafe is so overrated , I understood it when I visited .and after there i frequently visited there ..must visit I have always loved this place so much .this place has got everything that a good restaurant consists of .I had heard quite a bit about this place , so decided to visit it on the special occasion of our anniversary .I must say , it was better than I had hoped for .a great place for a date .a great place for a date .Could do much better .AWESOME .Had been here for a team lunch , nothing great to write about .It was my first visit and it was a great experience .overall a good experience .but u hate the fact that they always run out of my favourites on the menu .I do remember having enjoyed my meal and the experience , overall .So , my recommendation is : Go d place is great ...i mean u jus dnt realise dat u hav enterd a small lane in bandra lookin @ hw spacious d restaurant is If you ' re looking for a great meal without any budget constraints - this is the place to go to I remember the first time I visited here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were full to our heads Must must must visit - the variety , the presentation , the staff - brilliant And don ' t forget to reserve at least 10 days ( pfft ) in advance to get a table All in all , one of my favourite restaurants in Bombay And NO - IT ISNT OVERRATED loved it Not a big waoowww...if you have visited the Barbeque Nation outlets in other cities like Mumbai or Chennai , you can notice great difference in food menu , ambiance etc .Over hyped..Def going back there again .all that you were missing from Mumbai is now in Gurgaon .....Have been going to Rajinder Da DHABA for about 12 years now and I haven ' t seen a place with so much rush of customers .Superb Overall this place is Good and worth trying .GULATI is the Best choice in the Pandara Road cluster of restaurants .............Rocking place .Think about this...by far my favorite place in cyber - hub and i never miss an opportunity to suggest it as the place to eat well Oh Calcutta is also there ....people go eat and let them fight it out but let me tell you it's worth it .plus it wasn't that crowded as i but i find this place decent enough to hang around .Overall a good restaurant in the area .very Innovative Over all I enjoyed the food and would love to go again .Guys u do a good Job there .Ideal place to be in with freinds....Thursday a good day to go .But I ' d be lying if I didn ' t say that there is an element of hype to the legend .What a place to celebrate ur birthday .Awesome restaurant which is mewly opened in C.P and it is by warehouse .if you are into indulging in fine - dining sorts one night , do go here .Been here with Friends 1.5 yr back .Quite pleasant experience it was ...Would like to visit soon in winters...Still the best place for me in Taj It was a let down i been in luv wth nandos frm newzealand .unfortunately , i decided to celebrate my birthday there didn't want to spoil my mood that night so we didn't leave a negative feedback after dinner , i had heard so much about this place , that i just had to try it .This place has been my hangout for a long long time .Though i wont rate it too high , its a place best visiting for all .it couldn't get any better .Must try .it's the best place to be on Saturday nights .been to this place ......Cool to hang out with friends .Its a must visit place .Its different from other normal restaurants .Surely a place to visit .Just too good .Don ' t miss out .Fantabulous This is a jewel hidden under the big names like dominos , pizza hut etc .Mostly groups of collegiate can be seen over here .When we reached , we were told by the concierge on the ground floor that we might not find a free table and the place is full , but were free to go check - and we did .Yauatcha is easily one of my favourite restaurants .Having been a regular there since its inception , I try out at least one new dish each time I dine there , and have still not managed to try everything thanks to its vast menu .Maintaining consistency is no easy task and they have mastered its art .I give Yauatcha a full 5.0 Rating because it delivers fantastic food , great service , a wonderful ambience with comfortable seating and ample parking .Would recommend this to anyone and everyone ..Definitely will come back soon Good job Will recommend it to others Everything about this place was right .Cheers the place is good ....definate must have ...ALL ARE SUPERB....Overall not a nice experience .very good place .No doubt HRC has a cult following throughout the world .This is seriously vintage .The popularity of this place has only increased with time unlike 99 % of places in Delhi which get outdated within a couple of years .A must visit So , its a romantic place .You have greenery around .A place to be for fun evening .A must visit place .But beyond this , the place is just above average .Didn ' t expect this .Romantic .Refreshing .I had never seen anything like dat .There are scooters parked mainly and you will have to stand and have your food which is the main reason why people prefer take away .The only problem this place has is lack of proper arrangements for people to have their food .Romantic fr sure Unnecessarily hyped place Definitely an awesome fine dine modern food eating experience .They should be reserving only a selected number of tables in advance and leave the rest for walk in guests .Must try once Superb this place is very famous..though i guess a bit over rated ...Well , I had done my share of research before I went to Chandigarh , found this place happening and it indeed was .Love it .It was our 7th / 8th visit .this is just a mini version of bbq nation .not that good ..One hell of a place to eat .Been here a few times already and this place has never been a let down .So it is a great place for peaceful date .place is again huge so no worries for seat without reservation .BETTER THAN MOST OF THE BIG NAMES LIKE PIZZA HUT , DOMINOS ETC .kUDDOS TO THE OWNER .The perfect place for a sports fan .If you ' re a sports fan , this is the place to go .But I guess that ' s the price we have to pay to have a ball , that said it ' s a great place to hangout with friends .Nice place to hangout and enjoy with friends .Especially liked the way they have tried to make maximum utilisation of the property by keeping it intact .This is an amazing place .the parties are good as well .i had done party ' s many time ' s in TL and that was good experience This has been my 4th attempt to reserve a table for 2 , and have not been successful .overall gud This place is going places pretty soon .AER Four Season top the list .Great place to visit at any time of the day .Go out and make your special day even more special here .The first thing came out fgrm m y mind when i enter there is " WOWWW " .Must go place i must sayyyyy 5 / 5 rating .been here before .please improve the standard .i would prefer to go to some other restaurant .Quite satisfactory nd a must visit place ...finally had an opportunity to visit this place which had been a very prominent feature of Connaught Place .My first visit to townhouse and am glad i went there .rating is just minus This place has been on my wishlist for a long time now .A fun place to chill out at any point of the day .Very urban and chilled out .Liked whats dome with the place .Nothing gr8 I completely feel this place works on 2 things hype & amp ; PR .Surprisingly , the entire restaurant was empty and we were the only ones at 9 : 30PM .Awesome everything .Loved it But overall a great place .the place was also good for the any celebration.I may not go again , considering that there are a zillion options around .The staircase to this place on first floor of N block , outer circle , CP would give you an impression that it is some regular and tiny place .The best time to visit this place is after 11.This place is buzzing .Had been there quite a few times .i also want try one time bottel chirmmy If you are planning on having fun , this definitely is NOT the place to go awesome ..Visited this place last week with my wife to celebrate her birthday and was frankly disappointed by the overall experience .Though our initial experience in terms of being ushered to our ( reserved ) table was good , unfortunately , that was the beginning of our disappointment .While cost cutting is a good idea per se , being stingy is a different ball game altogether .Last but not the least , if you looking for a quiet place to spend a romantic evening with a loved one , give this place a skip .Until next time , adios..The icing on the cake was the presence of around 100 - 200 bugs / mosquitoes at the same level as the food plates .Lovely & amp ; awesome They should open their branches in other cities too ...Good place All in all worth a visit .but not the least the crowd was sexy ....Great place for dinner date .However the experience was neutral .Good in olden days .Now a shady joint Guess you guys are struck off my ever wanting to come to you list .I was visiting delhi and I ' m so glad I came here Definitely a must visit if you are in this side of delhi He SAD She SAD ..so choose wisely because you will b lucky if you ' d be able to switch seats .Not sure y this is 2nd position in trending Nothing too good or too bad about it .Appreciated .All together I would call this place " a silent player " , came up silently as a surprise and doing quite good .Shit Place .could improve a lot ........if there is one place that does not need any more reviews , its this one and its not hard to see why it is one of my favorite restaurants in Bangalore Smokehouse is one of the few places though that cant go wrong whatever they do Good place ....Its simple....just d presence of a parsibaba restaurant in gurgaon makes me visit this place again and again .....All in all a must visit ..i visited on last sunday with my family ...So , I prefer Skyye They r trying to hype up the place by showing off their attitude .I can hardly comment anything negative on this place .Went der at nyt around 9 bt had to wait till 10 for seats ...but den i hear it is a famous place ...cannot comment .located at cyberhub It is one of the best restaurants in the city wow hoping to visit it soon again ....don ' t go ...you will be disappointed , But All in all I must say this is a place that i would recommend as a must visit .ok food , ok place , ok staff , ok deco , just ok !seriously.....just ok .To begin with sigree global grill is a perfect place for a food with good ambience .Overall a pace worth visiting many times yo have good foos .nice place .bt overall nice experience Been there twice and must say it has been worth the visit .Place gets full by 9 and by 11 things start to get crazy .All and all a good place to party with your friends .Had been one of our favorite haunts for the last decade or so ....is a tremendous feeling that cannot be described in words , and probably that is why I would still visit the place in times to come .Everything about Kaidi Kitchen is impeccable..I loved it and plan to take my family there soon .Ohk place not so nice Nice place to hang out the Outdoor seating which i was not very much comfortable , where on one side of the table they had soft cushion seating and on the other side chairs made from steel ....will be back I have been here many times and every time it has been a GOOD experience .Perfect weekend place to be ...Girls can hv a blast Classy place for a perfect romantic date .best meal had in a long long time .My family is huge fan of this restaurant nd we manage to dine here atleast twice a month I have had friends and family telling me that if they went there without a reservation , they were given a table , but i was refused bookings seven days in advance too Huge fun n good restaurant .I wanna dinner so my frnd rcommended to go to alimentosAnd I got a prfrct restaurant It was just fine .I will definitely go back here every time I ' m in CP Awesome place .we hardly find a parsi restaurant in apni dilli , hence the novelty factor and the waiting time .Such a beautiful place in one of the most breathtaking forts in this country .All in all , a must visit for everyone who goes to Jaipur First look amazing .Crowded place .sunday evening , a company of good friends , open terrace and some leaisure time at disposal .!My friends n I were very hungry and happened to visit this place on a Saturday afternoon .We came to this place and it was quite awesome .monkey bar actually takes the buck if you really want to chill ...any day recommended for a place to chill out ...This restaurant is my favourite list .I did not expect this place to be quite upmarket until I reached there .This place surely attracts one of the best crowd from the city .The right time to hit the place is 11 pm on weekends ..maintained their standard since forever.A place to go with your loved one .Just the place to be at if you ' re looking for a rather romantic / cozy date night with your special someone They ' re amazing Went here with my beau and we loved everything Must visit if you have a minimum of 3 - 4 hours to spare If you are looking for a table on saturday night and a happening place .This is the place to be .A fantastic place to visit : ) Went here on a Saturday evening and had to wait for about an hr .Definitely worth it Amazing place .And ( like us ) you may forgiven to think that the name implies another cafe like lounge that serves beer towers to the gypsy twenties - something socialite .On the top floor of a still unfinished commercial building is The Mughsot Lounge .Very good place .superb This places impresses on many fronts .Thus , you can have your peace of mind and your conversations with no external factor playing a role .Accidentally stepped in to Khaan Saab and what a pleasant surprise it was A view of green bangalore from 13th floor is a feast for eyes .One can see green bangalore from here .Liked it An apt place for having a nice romantic date .Not that bad and not that good .Its one tym going restaurant...?Joeys is a small place ...but don ' t go by its size , oh no Definitely going to visit this place soon When you are here , you are at the 35th floor .A must visit place Perfect place to spend a peaceful evening with your partner .I just want to visit this place every weekend Great cafe .cyber hub definitely has better joints .wouldn't want to back unless it's someone else's treat .Will visit again : ) loved it it was decent but could definitely improve .Four of us went to Smoke House Deli sometime back simply because the reviews were great and we had heard so much about the place .Great experience : ) All in all a very pleasant experience would definitely come back .Found the place to be vet lively for a Monday evening .Mugshot is inside jewel square mall which is still not renovated completely .This place is really well done .But guys the msg is not welcome : ( Just awsome if you want to Lighten up your mood in the middle of a hectic day at work ...this is the place to be in Cyber Hub Definitely must visit if you are in Hyderabad ..not great .All in all a good place to hangout .Their happy hours too are quite convenient to enjoy .Brilliant place to chill and have a good time .My favourite hangout in Mumbai .Really wanted to visit this place since long and was really excited about it too .But as it turned out , the place is not that exciting afterall .I went there on tuesday night around 7 : 30 .That was a disappointment .That is one thing you cannot miss after visiting this place .The place could not stand up to my expectations and it was disappointing ....Personal party @ the M - floor : being away from the main floor service was a challenge , air con sucks..Its the best to go in winter..Never disappoints you Overall pathetic experience Wasn ' t that grt experience for me .What more do you need for a special dinner .This place can easily be for the lovebirds in the city .Preferable time is night .Awesome experience .Some of tye servers were also the same when I saw them ages back when I was a kid and use to come with my mom dad , will love to go back tyere again and again and again I love it .Heard about Masala Library from a friend and have been wanting to go for ages I would recommend everyone try this place out It is always filled so one needs to have some time and patience in hands before going there .I am horrified by hotmillion .This day will haunt me forever .to me its a brand Man - this is easily in my top 5 restaurants in Mumbai .If you haven ' t been to Yauatcha - I envy you - because you are in for a real treat Mozarella , name sounds nice .And it holds true in this case .If you visit this place on NEw Year day , trust me you may not be able to place order as the the flood of foodies is at its peak extending to the main road .Mark this place on your wish list .The place is so crowded that you may feel as if people have gathered for a mass ( especially in evening ) .I have been to this place many many times and it is always a delight and worth the travel .The gate opened and it felt like we ' re stepping into some other world .I saw a lot of pizza boxes piled up besides the tables where we sat .Better than Domino ' s and Pizza Hut .Had an awful experience at this place .I never expected this type of mistake from such a big and popular restaurant .Will not recommend it to anyone .An awesome place for a group of friends to hangout .also the place is so out of town , if you are going here for first time plz make sure you know the address well .plz plz avoid going here .Was excited ( not anymore ) to be at this place EXOTICA .Yautcha is easily the top three Restaurants in Bombay for me .Have been there around 20 times and never been dissapionted .Thank you for keeping the standards .Its a nice place .Grt place .The best in market , try it once before you die : ) Cheers , If in Delhi , visit this place once , then visit it again and again .One hell of an amazing place ?overhyped ..A Must visit place .Just one word Amazing if you are going there on weekends may the luck be with you .we waited more than half an hour to get a table for 3 .The place is just amazing .You will find young people of the age group 18 - 26 which makes it a very happening place .I would recommend you to go early here on d weekends as it gets really full very fast My overall experience here was good Have been to Atmosphere 6 a couple of times with family and friends .Plus , I LLOOOOVVEE Starbucks to the core .I can have it anytime anyday I wont ever get bored of it .Still , good to try .Try this outlet .It might become your favorite ; ) The restaurant shall evaluate making portions for one person only along with decreasing the rates .a must try if u r in kolkata Every thing is supervised to meet the high standards set .Go without any expectations , and you ' ll step out with a big smile and fond memories .Horrible place This place is just not worth it They ' d do better to replace the entire management , chefs and the menu and start from scratch..I visited here just few days back on my engagement anniversary day and I would say I really had a wonderful time here .I would definitely visit again .All the readers do visit .i loved the creation .sundays are usually over crowded ..( not seen such mistakes in any restaurant ) .been seeing this and wanted to visit , as its a huge place with 5 floors .2nd floor and 3rd are meant for buffet and regular sitting .the buffet space was little congested .Celebrated my birthday over here with my bunch of frenz n had the best bday ever Apart from the name nothing is good .the fact that it is a non air conditionedand has no music is a bit of a turn off for me .its very classy .a two - level seating , indoors and outdoors .for me the place to sit is on the upper floor ....................An ok kind of place .Pretty small I will say .It is right next to the station , so isn ' t really well placed .Pretty small I will say .We hopped in here to celebrate a friends birthday and it was amazing .I have been here before with some colleagues .We loved being here .It really pinched me the money I wasted in Urban Asia .It ' s just show off and I would say " All fart and no shit " .If you want just show off and don ' t bother about the taste then Urban Asia is a the place .Pathetic .A must go place ..Overall I ' ll rate 4.5 out of 5 .A place to be if u wanna have a gooood time Alwayz satisfying .A good place for family Love this place It never disappoints .classy  Been on my wish - list for a while .This place scores even before entering inside , the Blue door it is Thumbs Up & amp ; Cheers its determinately a restaurant that we will come back to ...first class !.Great experience .Finding Olive Bistro is tough .This restaurant is not elderly - friendly ( way too many steps to climb ) .Olive Bistro did not impress at all .Never going back to this place again The worst part of it all were the flies .There were flies everywhere .You know like one of those cozy , nice little places where you n your school / college gang hang out most often .Our one hour lunch quickly became three hours .Would recommend.; I would recommend this to a friend .Much enjoyment was had at High Ultra Lounge .Have been to this place twice .Moreover , this is also your ticket to see Mumbai ' s real estate situation personified - cramped seating , limited space to move around .Yeah , that bad .Moreover , this is also your ticket to see Mumbai ' s real estate situation personified - cramped seating , limited space to move around .To sum it up it ' s a wonderful place to go especially with that special someone .the whole team , front and back stage created a wonderful experience which matched our first visit and we look for ward to returning .With a so hyped name nothing great about it .soda bottle opener wala is a very different place and concept .its perfect for an outing with friends .Have been to this place a couple of times .Since its a restaurant serving cuisine that ' s not available everywhere except a few places in Mumbai and parsi households , it already gets some points from my side .i went to plan b on a friday for lunch .its not really a big place , not very small either .it was almost full when we got there .overall i just loved plan b and i will be visiting again in future .The perfect romantic place .Had visited several times and experience is foodilecious visit by visit .Nice experience @ sanyam aggarwal best candle light dinner in Bangalore .but again not that great .If you stay in Mumbai and not visited this place , you are definitely missing out on something amazing .We went for a Friends Birthday .Everything was totally Amazing .Completely PACKED That alone is enough for time spent there .always crowded ...been there on a Sunday - it was full .there are better places if you are looking for pan Asian food .I love this place .Only positive things to say This was not accepted from a hotel of the class of Marriott .Very close to the airport and far for people in the Vaishali Nagar area but the place is so good that the distance doesn ' t matter .Great place to go for special occasions .Keep up the good work yes , on the weekends as well ..Well , let ' s say it is a famous place .I would definitely recommend if you intend to sit outside , else avoidable.The inside section is too dark and dingy for my liking .we went here for my birthday party .i thought it to be just another lounge .proved me wrong .this is the place everyone would like to visit .One of my favourite haunts .Had been here twice with colleagues .well done .Nice .but that was also very unsatisfactory ..would highly recommend to those who love to EAT DRINK AND TALK at the same time ...Would love to visit again very soon ., truffles always come to my mind.the oly disadvantage is the crowd here .....thou i had to wait for almost the length of a T20 game , 3 1 / 2 hrs , to get in ; it was worth the wait .i hope the concerned authorities do make a note of this .A good place ....The entrance of this place smells like anything its snugly located in ra Puram and looks very cozy .As the name goes , it really is rocky .I don ' t think you ' ll regret it ....overall is a good place of eating out .Terrific place with just about the right mix of everything Apart from this point it was a pretty decent experience .After months of hearing about Cyber hub - I finally made it there .After a bit of initial survey , we decided to try Soda Bottle Openerwala .A nice place .Recommended for once .......One must try this for the legacy..They got it all ..Been visiting pandara road since i was a kid..And every visit was a great experience .first of all thank you # Zomato for letting me know about Shanghai Salsa .okay it was okay .Awesome place for a corporate outing..Surely going there again soon totaallyyy a funn visit..!!! Will surely visit soon .went today to the legendary karim @ jama Masjid ..can go once but certainly not the place to go again n again .I was very excited to go for the first time but I wasn ' t very impressed .Crowd was so so good .Crowd was so so good .Each item has been carefully documented and labelled , and every single piece is of significance as it had belonged to legends from the world of rock .This is one of the oldies in Delhi .Can try it out once .i took my family to the restaurant and couldn't take not more than one in the lift it was very small and scary .Considering that it ' s a well settled chain , all such key aspects must be looked into .Overall a fine place for a good evening .A perfect place to spend your evening .Suggestion : take a stroll before selecting a seat .recently we went here with office mates .we enjoyed a lot .good Work Barbeque nation Place is so crampy .If you around CP , must visit this place .Try it here .To go place to impress to someone who you really want to impress The place is very to locate just near the Amphitheater in Cyberbub .huge cafe ..mostly crowded ..I ' ll give full points to this place .Awesome place .Double thumb up .we have visited bukhara restaurant around middle of august and we were happily surprised .nice.NEVER go here only name no nothing And couldn ' t believe it was full of crowd .right from Start to the End everything was Perfect .tummy Full ...though they were packed both times .I ' ve been to this place about 6 - 7 times and have enjoyed the experience everytime .Its one of my top options when visiting cyber hub .The gentry is always very much mixed .Good A place really close to my heart .Lots of talking and eating to do : ) Sitting in the waiting area with my grandparents with an estimated wait of one hour duration .The reviews promise it should be worth the wait .Damn hope it is Customer alert : be careful if you are coming on a Sunday .However , this never happened during my innumerable visits to BYD before .Idiots Excellent .....still feeling rejuvenated to visit one more time ....classic place to hangout..Thank u A place for ppl who are hungry fr ambeince plus silence altghr while on dinning with frends and family Went on friday late evening , was crowed as expected .Went on friday late evening , was crowed as expected .Probably need to check the place after 5 - the dhaba part opens in the eve only .Over rated .What ' s obviously missing is for this city to allow the best ever chain to serve beer and cocktails .That ' s HRC pretty much anywhere in the world .Great place to hang - out on weekends .I was here with my friends to grab some bites .Every one should visit this outlet at least once One of my most visited hunger point .Had been there a couple weeks .I jus feel in luv with the place .Overall good experience .Good place for a Friday \ Saturday night .Cool This one lived up to my expectations Absolutely loved it .May be next time i went there on s Saturday afternoon , thinking it would be deserted , but to my surprise it was buzzing with loads of people .it was good to see everyone having a great time there .would be back to hrc one of the Best hrc in India .would be back to hrc I always loved the Karim ' s in Jama Masjid .I simply love this place .I will surely visit this place again : - D Overall it was a fair experience .My home away from home I ' ll never visit Gurgaon without spending as many evenings as possible here .Had to wait for like an hour to enter and the wait was worth the wait .Good experience .Must visit place .It is rather one of my favourite joints out there in CP .In short , I loved the place and its a nice spot to sit and chill out with friends / Family .The over hyped place in village dese days .V ol happily enter .But then upon entering also , we are asked to wait for another 5 min so that the people sitting before us can pay their bill .Overall my rating - 2.5 / 5Keep socialising ppl A nice place to go for a drink with friends .Do not visit during monsoon as there are a lot of insects during that time and the food doesn ' t seem very hygienic .If you want a quick bite and eat snacks , HM is a good option .Its an awesome place for Family and friends get together , sitting arrangements on a large Round tables makes food more enjoyable so as the interaction with your mates .I ' ll simply awesome once again .Its just awesome : - ) Hot Millions has been a favourite ever since we were in School .
They ' re well worth it and are an important part of Chandigarh ' s culinary history !
Domino ' s is no longer a good choice .
ok types not very good.
Awesome place compared to all the other places in adarsh nagar , raja park
Ooo Nostalgic : ) It ' s been one of the places I have been hanging out to eat since childhood .
I have enjoyed a lot dere .
You must try this
many prefer
its a nice place ....
n it was a delight ...
recomended from my side ...
Very cozy location on gerri route...
Surely its super hit as every pizza outlet in d town copies dem......
I will never visit this place again .
Overall bad experience .
Better go to mainland china or barbeque nation in 26 sector .
However when I visited the Beltola joint , I was amazed .
It is a small joint and during lunch hours had to wait to get a table .
been there twice ....
go there on a warm wintery afternoon ..
go there on a warm wintery afternoon ..
it has been my pet family resturant for around 10 years .
thats disappointing .
Great job , keep going strong !
i went to this place on the first day of new year 2014 .
and i was very much relieved to say that i wasnt disappointed .
kudos !
the place was proper and spic n span and i really enjoyed my meal there ...
but sometimes in weekends and festive seasons it'll be a bit hard for someone to find a seat as it is packed with customers .
the first resort in Ghy which i had visited the first time some 6 - 7 years back !
though it's a little away from the city , what you get to see there is quite satisfying .
..
I have been to tao last time for a party .
This is the second time i visited Crackling Mustard and like always i was not at all disappointed .
Overall another very good experience .
Highly recommended .
It brings back the feeling of a bengali restaurant .
awesome ..
hopefuly dis was our last visit to dis place .
a big cross
I don ' t recommend going to Park Prime .
must try ..
i have visited Pizza Hut hell lot of times ...
Food , Friends and Drinks ....
Would visit again .
You may choose other place but for a normal hangout with friends , its good .
i don't think one can ask for more from a restaurant !
Simply try it man and you will love it
but can get crowded and noisy .
their standards have sadly gone down
which disappointed me ...
it was a very bad experience altogether ...
we had a very awful experience ..
would never like to visit this place again neither will recommend others to visit this place ....
But yes it was not upto the mark as expected at this kind of property .
should increase the capacity
otherwise awesome
i didn't enjoy it at all .
i loved it so much 
its a must try 
you can always find the place full .
no other pizza outlet in Guwahati stands a chance against it .
brands " the largest fast food chain in the world , Pizza Hut is a renowned venture across the globe and it has definitely caught some attention in town already .
i am not too fond of domino's pizzas .
I didnt liked this kfc much
Fantastic ...
too less seating capacity 
being just around 300 metres away from my place , i thought of trying it out once .
i think it would be a safe choice to skip this place .
boring ..
It is indeed one of the best clubs in chandigarh .
My all time favourite .
We make it a point to visit this little place whenever we are near Latasil .
A must visit 
a much better place would be Quick Pick and Chung fa if u looking at good chinese at reasonable rates .
This is one classy joint .
Give it a try .
Nice place .
and since we happened there around 2 in the afternoon so wasn't crowded too .
and since we happened there around 2 in the afternoon so wasn't crowded too .
good 
a must try in Guwahati 
Overall : a 3 out of 5.
Still , it is one of those restaurants one should visit ( even if only once ) in the city .
...
however this particular loyan's has an added option of sitting and eating , and the area is quite clean so more brownie points for that !

Cool 
but perhaps not the single best .
jus simply 'ok' ...
would suffice for it , cause the place failed to live up to my expectation .
Itz good 
i would ask anyone who is reading this not to visit that bar .
Worst place to visit if u r with cousin .
Drizzle was great place to relax during the week end .
Dominos Vaishali !
And thankfully no under age doings happen here as they are very strict about checking IDs right at the entrance .
It can be rented out for exclusive private parties and corporate get - togethers also which is a plus !
Do drop by for a ' let down your hair evening ' ..
This might be the next hip party place soon .
Area 51 used to one of the premium party place few years back .
Now this place has lost its charm .
Its open till 1 am while other party places are open till 2 am .
The only worst part I could find is crowd .
I had a great experience .
It was good .
Recommended only if ur not in for dominoes / Pizza Hut .

lot desirable as far as maintenance is concerned ....
washroom stinks , mosquitoes and even flies .....
Good place .
doesn't have anything special to pen down !
good for just turned 21 people !
its a good place for the younger lot !
Take my advice ; visit the place once in a month so that you don ' t get bored .
Brilliant place .
I went to this place with a bunch of my friends on a weekend during its first month of inauguration .
Apart from this , they have these small contests like drink 6 shot glasses of beer with a straw in 20 seconds and get a beer for free .
Fun place .
I will definitely return .
the first restaurant in Guwahati for me 
and certainly as told by others it has great Chinese and Thai food .
but for hangouts it's a nice option 
Loved it !
not a single mistake done .
best part u can reach her at 1 am n still get a table , bt after waiting in d que ..
If youre in Jaipur and are looking for a nice place to dine , you got to visit the terrace grill .
infact a great place to spend a nice winter evening 
This is the place to be 
Basically , a total chilling - out - place to be .
Air Lounge is the perfect place to unwind .
love this place !
a great place to hang out with friends or loved ones .
decent crowds , safe place and its got this at home vibe .
One of the best in town .
i wish it could be a little more fine dining 
But if you are going there with your family or with your girlfriend please avoid it .
I guess they have two different sections one for food and the other for liquor and sheesha .
And a wonderful experience all together for a disabled person .
den nandos is d perfect place to be dere ..
good place to go ...
Loved the over all experience .
i was disappointed in both regards .
Excellent Experience ?
Great place to be with your special ones .
Keep it up guys 
overall it was a fair experience .
very disappointed 
not aware that only couples allowed .
the only thing that will make u irritate is the long waiting list ....
Once it was a favourite place for our group .
this Is a Kind Of Restaurant For Which It Can Be Rightly Said That The Packaging Is Worth More Than The Actual Product Itself .
kentucky Fried Chicken is probably the most popular fast food chain in the city .
It could be better 
You will have a very good evening with friends 
not much to say bout it 
but not - it is modified and looks disaster .
totally crowded place and not even clean at all .
This is just the place .
A good place when you want to relax and have a quiet dinner..
Maybe that should give you an idea how bad a place can be .
What a disaster .
Overall an horrible experience .
One of the best restaurants in kolkata .
" But trust me this restaurant is a class apart .
Looking foreward to my next visit here .
absolutely amazing .
amazing 
Flip side : the restaurant turn into a club on week ends , the two bar counter are always crowded so getting a drink is kind of tough .
Club : one of the most happening clubs of Chennai .

Absolutely loved our experience .
One of those restaurants you save the 5 * for.
worth it 
Will go back again 
which was really nice no doubt ...
Exquisite and awesome .
...Did not find any girls in this place and tharkey type men looming around .
I will rate this outlet at 5 / 5 - because of its consistent quality right across , which is unusual in such multi - fare outlets .
..Loyans , got to know about it from zomato itself and finally got a chance to taste it .
.Starting with the location its a bit out of commercial place but still accessible .
.Thumps up from my side .
i think its overrated .
gulati , serves great .
i went all the way from New Alipore to Barrackpore by road to this well reviewed Dada Boudi Hotel 
the eatery has got two portions - the outside one is small & amp ; too drab with attached washbasins at one corner .
The place looks a normal food joint with multiple decks to choose from .
Boasted as the ' haldirams ' of Jaipur , I chose to visit this place with my family for dinner .
The place looks a normal food joint with multiple decks to choose from .
I always make it a point that I visit Hot Millions when ever I visit the city beautiful Chandigarh..
Would not recommend the place .
If there was ever a restaurant that was aptly named , it was definitely this one .
Believe me , better is coming .
I would visit this place again and again just so that I can taste every single thing on the menu 
Unsure why this place is trending in the top list .
Nothing really special apart from a regular bar .
Disappointed 
i love it soo muchhh ......
thought u have to wait for 1 hour to eat in it , i also did it .....
but actually it is worth it 
congratulations .
One of the best place to hangout late night .
it was on a weekday that we visited them and i was surprised to see the crowd .
I didn ' t see the hype that reinforces Loyans .
i guess its run by jains which makes it jain friendly too 
its close proximity to the Barrackpore station is a big plus point .
this pizza hut is big and spacious compared to some other franchises around the country .
after a grand feast i realised the reason why they are so famous and pull in somuch crowd .
you just cannot have enough of this .
it is out of the way from mainstream Kolkata so not a first choice .
small little place 
it is a small joint 
Air is sure one of the best lounges in city .
Air is huge , spacious .
A true savious for people working in the night shifts or friends getting together for drinks at night .
I went to this place reading its reviews over zomato , and trust me every word turned out to be true .
Must go for everyone .
Good job 
that felt like Royal 
Its an awesome concept .
heard much about it and today i was there for the first time .
a worth going place .
will visit again 
Thumps up from my side .
i'd say it is good .
i am not sure if thats happened to everyone or its just the fault in my stars , both the times i'd been there , the place was choked by loud and volumous diners ; just enough to ruin the entire atmosphere .
Visited this place on basis of reviews .
Oh great place for a fantastic dinner .
Very much appreciated .
Surely recommend this place for a good dinner .
Loved them all .
it was fab 
Very very good 
...good place to hang out .
It seems more like they are trying to bank on the idea of a restaurant that is open at 4am in the morning .
i can die for it .
its quite an off - route place as well .
accomodation is the major drawback of this joint .
its quite an off - route place as well .
but the waiting is what will kill u 
total disaster ..! 
the best part of this joint is their opening hours .
the long waiting .
amazing place ..
great job guys ..
u guys have a fantastic thing going here .
keep it up ..
Worth a try 
What a place 
And I have always stepped out satisfied with this place .
0D is more like a picnic spot for teenagers .
i love this place just because i love it 
just step out of the local railway station and the first shop you see with a huge line in front of it is 
a very small and cosy hotel with no ac and frankly , hot inside , 
nice to see dada - boudi here ...
only suggestion due to paucity of space better enjoy with family at own place ...
which was absolutely amazing .
this is not a typical place for sit down meal .
This place is just amazing and I ' m a H U G E fan 
Absolutely in love with this place 
it Might Be a Small Place And Unhygenic , Well Talking About Hygine i Must Mention Those Certain Times When We Say " let's Have Fuchka 
although it's Small 
The experience was excellent .
all in all this makes a must visit food joint reccomended by me .
lil did we know that this place would grow up to be one of jaipu's elite restaurant ...
i suggest to go there at lunch ..
double thumbs up to them for that .
One of the best places for group gatherings and parties 
Good place to be 
; - ) amazing experience ..
big thumbs up 
i love dis place 
I had to throw a party to some very close friends and was looking for options , due to weekend was not able to find a confirmed place in Forresta and suddenly someone suggested this place .
A must visit place 
Decent place .
But something I didn ' t like was the fact that it charges an entry , not a cover..
Overall , nice place to chill out .
but not what i expected .
its totally worth visiting .
My only complaint is that they just have 2 outlets and that is kinda a let down if you dont live in either Malad or Andheri .
waiting kills u ...
Joey ' s special was the best 
Nothing special .
I like this place a lot .
Excellent place .
..
So go to boveda and make that sat night special.
Have been to this place many times .
Used to be good .
there's usually a waiting time of at least 15 - 20 mins , especially during weekends .
love it  
the happy hours are cherry on the top .
Really " feel good " as its tag line .
have heard so much about this place so while on Zomato decided to visit this as well ...
amazing 
Cheers .
.luvv it .
Perfect place for a romantic dinner .
Overall , a place worth a one - time visit .
joey's was on my to - visit list since months now .
lovely place and best new club in the city.
comfortable , relaxing and enjoyable .
every saturday air is the right choice : ) 
it's an experience 
So overall a satisfactory experience ( y ) A visit to this place is suggested .
6 people and has table tops for people who wanna enjoy a drink or two and just have fun .
good Place ...
loved it to the core ..
highly recommended ..
a must visit place to hangout with friends and family too 
we went for our office party at q'ba as suggested by colleagues .
.recommended.
Hope to visit again .
Will visit again .
you ll always find this place crowded ...
Quite good ?
Been here loads and loads of times .
If you wannaa get over Dominos smokins , this is the place to go .
though the place is very small , congested 
i like q'ba 
Overall it was a nice experience 
Visited the restaurant yesterday with family over dinner .
Such a horrible experience .
But will neither recommend this restaurant nor visit ever again .
A nice place to hangout with ur friends .
better food , better service and people smiling all around .
Will definitely recommend .
do not understand why public so gaga .
This place used to be good , now it ' s horrible ( Sorry for being harsh ) .
the occasion was special and so was the diner .
over all a wonderful experience ( 
It was an amazing experience coming to this place .
air Cafe Lounge looks set to appeal to shoppers looking to relax , office workers and those who enjoy interesting food in comfortable and informal surroundings .
with good local parking , Air Cafe Lounge would also make an attractive location for private parties and events .
in no time it has became hyd's Best and most preferred Lounge ..
air Cafe Lounge at Jublee Hills .
in No Time Air Cafe Lounge turns out to be city's Best Brand ...
This place is just too good .
Awesome place 
Its a nice and warm place to be 
Nice place to be 
Good place to visit .
always preferrable for take - away rather to dine in .
A place for Bengali food loves and even those who do not like it much are also sure to fall in love with it .
I love this place everytime in a new way I visit here .
This is a favourite one of mine .
I recommend this to all to please come and try it .
Nothing special about it .
Its a Bar cum Restaurant .
Hi All , One of the finest place to hangout with your friends .
You ll just love to be here .
Wow Loved it .
And you can spend the time as long as you can .
personally felt great being here .
Awesome place .
.one of the must go places in jaipur 
gulati is a very popular restaurent .
nice family restaurent .
but always crouded .
its hard to find place .
You have to visit 
This is the right choice .
Nice choice for great occasions .
have heard lot of abt dis place ...
nd its amazing place ...
its hard to be in dis industry wid old name ...
but it did not disappoint u ..
alimentos , the place has a very delusioned feel to it.
overall i was satisfied and happy .
It was a great experience overall .
Overhyped 
We were here today celebrating a friends birthday .
If i have to sum it up it was an average experiance for me .
the very famous shiv Sagar fr mumbai is now in ahmedabad .
must try 
a very good experience 
When reaching there i manage to get a table for 4 after waiting for 10 mins .
So i guess its better to walking then call them .
Do try it .
have heard that this place is almost 20 to 25 yrs old 
Good .
One of my all time favourite restaurants in jaipur .
It has always been a good hang out place where we can go without a second thought .
i have been quite a few times to this place .
its huge and have this hall where you can arrange private parties .
You know instead of all this , the best advice is Just don ' t bother going here , it a total mess .
Shiv Sagar is simply great .
Recommended .
Visited there for first time .
waiting time is a turn off 
:( go early get seats 
Cool place to be 
wish they had more outlets in Mumbai 
Love this place .
No doubt the best .
This place is disgusting 
Do not go here 
The only thing that I did not like was the 1 week wait to get a table due to their small restaurant .
Thank you for the amazing experience 
Ond hell of a place 
Disappointing : - ( 
This made me think twice before going in to this place on a Saturday night and had to back off .
This is officially my fav .
good for nothing place ..
unnecassary hyped ..
i can't understand why people are rating it even 2 .
fully faltu.
very unhygienic .
!Give dis place a chance .
..hav a feel good feelin inside u as well .
..nd u won ' t have nything to regret...
Place is very nice to chill out with friends 
making it perfect for students .
what more can you ask for 
:small place ..
Has a good vibe going all the time 
dont miss t 
everything - be it the service , interiors or food is impeccable .
A good place for friends and family outing .
Gulati is an iconic name in Delhi ' s traditional eating circles and has maintained its connoisseurs .
Recommended for sure .
limited 
amazing 
felt lavish  
Nothing is better than this place on a Sunday evening .
Getting inside and getting a seat is a tough job .
we went there on a saturday night and the whole market had a good buzz with many people around .
we had a 15 minute waiting time 
but honestly it was well worth it .
Location : Statue Circle .
Doesn ' t get better than that 
Parking is a major headache during weekends .
Parking is a major headache during weekends .
To be precise , I would sum up my experience at this place to be pleasant .
One of the oldest famous resturant situated at pandara road .
..a den for late night family outings since our childhood .
good 
I would rather hop over to CP to grab something better ( atleast a better view ) .
...overall a good experience 
...overall a good experience 
True to it ' s name , Little Italy offers you everything you can possibly expect at an Italian restaurant .
It seems nice to see that they want you to have a good time as much as you want to 
the place seems gud , entered der with a gr8 exceptation 
but got a lil disappointed 
amazing place to be .......
all in all a very nice experience .
I would like to suggest that people should prefer to go for Night Owl instead of Batman .
I would like to suggest that people should prefer to go for Night Owl instead of Batman .
Highly disappointed with the feedbacks of appreciations we read from the feedbacks provided they might be friends of Batman .
The biggest lounge cum hookah place i saw here .
nice time pass 
but it more than makes up with the experience .
if you haven't been there yet , a definite must - visit for dinner .
This was my third visit to Koyla and after a long time .
Getting up to the restaurant is a task though .
You have to take stairs up as there is long queue for the lift or its not working .
They should definitely do something about it .
I have been to Sigree in powai as part of corporate culture .
I wanted to take my parents out for dinner here and we chose to reach here for my aunt ' s birthday .
Everything was perfect .
Apart from this everything was picture perfect .
A Friday night outing here will ensure a cool start to the weekend .
some things never change ...
Definitely worth a try .
though can improve .
A must visited place in pune 
i went to Shanghai Salsa on my friend's recommendation and it didn't disappointed me .
Walked in on a Friday night to find the place bustling with people all ready to get their drink on .
...the place is huge and was open till 3 am that night .
it was very good 
it seems a restaurant where many tourists and expats go , 
this is a very large place .
Gud , nice place to relax 
One of the worst experiences i have had since the time i started visiting resturants .
This is one of the rare restaurants , where thr is waiting even on weekdays , that ' s what happened with us as well .
But let me put it straight , it is worth the wait .
There are reasons why this one stands tall since 1959 , they have kept the standard intact .
Went with my uncle who has been regular visitor since 30 years .
He said he has never been disappointed here , and my uncle has travelled extensively all over the world .
Just enjoy n let me know your experiences 
Disappointment 
10d one awesome place to party with frnds and ur loved ones ...
went for retro night Friday ...
simply awesome must try 
A quaint little place just adjacent to lodhi gardens .
this is my second visit to delhi's most famous restaurant Gulati and trust me its awesome in all respects .
overall very nice experience .
it is recommended especially for families because outside you will find all over families waiting for their turn to enter in restaurant .
:to avoid waiting please visit around 8 to 830 pm because after that there is long waiting of 1 or 2 hours majorly in weekends .
In short worthless .
..Nothing great .
A superbly rocking place in Pune .
A must try party place in Pune : ) 
And the crowd was super charged .
It should be interesting to visit this place again when it ' s nini ' s kitchen .
firstly i must say it's not a sit and dine place .
been here twice in one day after i got my first salary .
overall a must visit place .
I have been a regular customer of this place since 2001 .
Seeing the high rating like 4.4 on zomato , I and my fried went to this place with very high expectations .
Rest all was very much unexpected and weird .
Location is kinda crappy .
First impression - its a great place .
Tried this sigree first time .
the best 
a Must try 
purely awesome 
It was a bad experience with replay as always .
The chain in Bombay matches it standards all over the world .
had a really nice time ...
Wouldn ' t suggest it to anyone .
Great place , always full of energy 
We travel all the way from gurgaon just to have it .
The expectation was really high after seeing the photos of the place and food .
but the downside is , it was pretty chilly and windy and they should've had some heaters put in some corners .
considering this was being touted as bbq nation's competition , we went there with really high expectations .
but no , we were utterly disappointed .
An awesome place to be .
Thanks to Mr.
Thanks for a memorable experience .
Went to this place for dinner .
Had done a reservation for 3 arnd 7pmCame to know after reaching the place dat kids are not allowed .
They allowed us after a long wait .
..was utter shit .
The bill these 3 things came to around 1.2kPeople with kids avoid this place and Jain ppl this place is not for you ' llThis place is only for drinks and not for food .
Rude lounge was much much better .
..I miss that place so much .
N I had a horrible time dnt care abt others if they had a good time as this is my personal experience .
full Marks .
......
had a real good time .
!But yes , it ' s an ideal place for a romantic evening .
a good place to hangout .
Definitely a place on the to - go list .
All smiles .
Overall , a nice place if you ' re looking for a relaxing evening and some conversion .
Will definitely go back again 
definitely the best place 
Best Lounge Of Chandigarh 
We went there on a weekday fearing the rush on weekends only to find the restaurant packed anyways .
We finally got our table 30 min later .
The place is predictably noisy as the Delhi families feel completely at home over here .
loved it ...
Was looking to get more out of the experience .
that's a down side .
Average .
must visit .
Thank you .
but the setting of the entire place is what makes me rate it this way .
Perfect place to go for a get together .
located at 2 mins walking distance from Barrackpore Station .
but space for dine in is congested and a long queue would be found on ocassions such as new year or christmas .
as for my experience , i loved it 
but when we got there , we pleaded to give us a table inside cause it was too cold for me .
Nice place in the heart of Delhi .
All in all a good place .
i always wanted a place where one could sit out and enjoy Delhi , and qba is an amazing relaxing place.
everthing is amazing abt this place 
Horrible night , worst experience in Pune .
We were here on of our early dates in delhi and had a superb experience 
!Recommended to visit with special person and special occasions 
but it's one of the best places around .
but nevertheless worth it .
Yes , definitely .
Amazing place .
.would love to visit again .
The downside of this restaurant is that there is too much waiting time , but I find it all worth after finishing the meal..
Go for it people .
awesome 
but overall it's amazing .
Awsm 
so probably one can conclude it ' s not a day place .
Worth a try 
What more could I have asked for 
Awesome place 
One of the finest longues....
was made a cherishable memory ..
which was awsummm ..
i gently reminded him that this is a fine dining facility , not a discotheque .
Love it .
.This place is awesome..
.m goin wid a generous 3 / 5 for dis place , good but not enough.
nice place to get together and have dinner in the centre of Delhi ..
and i must say ice lounge is well deserved .
I would thoroughly recommend ICE LOUNGE to anyone with a sweet tooth .
I know I ' ll certainly be returning soon .
!must go place .
The minute I stepped into this place , I felt like I was back in a Goa shack .
The place is so welcoming and relaxing , you don ' t feel like getting out .
Ever since the first time I went there , Tropical lounge has become my favorite .
I ' d recommend this place over any other joint in Jaipur .
If a classy romantic date night is on your list , this is the perfect dine - out for you .
An ideal family restaurant where one can come in big groups to chat and enjoy food .
The bottom line is that gulati restaurant deserves a visit .
very nice place .
gives you separate areas for bar and dining .
must try .
Urban Asia is truly a brilliant dining experience .
The place was packed when we entered but we chose to take seats by the bar .
I was amazed at the attention to detail .
We then were invited back to the bar , had a drink with the owner and ended up having a fabulous evening with filled with great conversation .
There might be many Asian restaurants in the city , but I would come back again to this one for how special my dining experience was .
And the location prime .
All in all a good experience 
its a very fine fine - dining restaurant .
i like them .
i will definitely try it again .
First of its kind .
a new place came up silently and gained points .
so thumbs up with recommendations .
Excellent 
Excellent .
Must try place .
One place I would always suggest to my cousins or friends from abroad is aer...
super place worth every penny .
of course they should really do something about the space issues .
Gud deals are available 
awesome experience .....
you start with long waiting time outside , 
but its worth it .....
the must have's are 
a worth going place ....
On the whole you will have a great experience here .
Overall a great experience .
Luved it 
The place is located at safdarjung enclave and is its main attraction .
I have been there for few times and it never gave me any complains .
The place has its own life .
By this I mean that the vibrance of the place especially after dusk its something else 
It was time for a family lunch and so this place was chosen .
This place in salt lake city centre was unknown to me a few years back but friends of mine suggested it to be quite something .
In spite of that , a great place 
its a small and old place .
.but truly speaking was a little disappointed.
..could have been better .
A must visit again .
Awesome place to hangout 
had a great evening and liked every bit here .
overall a must go place .
Will go back to this place everytime i go bangalore 
Worth a visit..
Great Location .
...Below Average .
cozy little place .
good for a quiet dinner .
Overall it ' s a total package .
I loved it .
Overall lacks on the basics .
a bit messy 
classyyy 
Amazing place 
...
We visited this restaurant on a Saturday eve with our friends .
Had our office party here & amp ; it was fabulous .
Had an Amazing experience guys 
We had gone there for a team party .
Juzz awsum 
Been there many times with ma uncle and again I go back for more 
Keep it up guyzz 
Delightful every time .
A must 
the entry was quite deceptive since the place is really spacious 
overall , great place and i intend to go there again pretty soon 
There aren ' t any words to describe .
I had a mesmerizing experience .
It has been a long time that I had wanted to try this place .
U would love to go and try more of it .
Smokin ' Joes is the only one that can come close but is still 2nd best .
The wait is worth it .
I had been with my family on my b ' day and had very bad experience .
I can ' t suggest the place to anyone .
..
nando's for me is a personal favorite ...
Awesome place enjoyed too much with friends.
An overhyped place .
Gulati is the classic old place on Pandara Road that has withstood the test of time .
Being around for such a long time isn ' t easy .
Restaurants come and restaurants go but this one has managed to stay for a long long time .
I think that is what keeps a restaurant alive .
It came out with flying colors .
And my adda these days .
Had heard a lot about this place , thanks to zomato and a couple of friends .
but for now its a big no to vist your place sorry 
I would have waited another hour to eat here .
What the heck....
...Nyc place to go wid frnds 
im definitely going back again : ) 
The place is amazing one of the best places 
Must visit 
Dont go with high expectations to high .
Go here 
Team is so happy to be there and will be visiting soon once again .
This is a place to be surely visited once you are in guwahati 
Try Gulati .
You hv decent sitting soace so can go with family too .
Over hyped 
Nice everything fine .
It is one of the best restaurants I have been to in long time .
I would really like to visit this place again .
Ya it is a good place 
But they are missing something .
just amazing..Thanks alot ?
We went on our wedding anniversary and it was probably the best decision .
Loved the food , ambience , service and decor .
Would love to visit again sometime for a dinner .
A perfect place that suites every occasion .
Firstly what a place 
this place is ideal for all kind of people ...
been to this place many times and get good response from the people there ...
All in all a good hang out for youngsters .
Keep it up and nice work 
I took my friend there for my birthday .
Overall it was a great experience .
I really enjoyed there .
it ' s a great place to hang out with your friends 
Worst experience ever 
Hard Rock Cafe is so overrated , I understood it when I visited .
and after there i frequently visited there ..
must visit 
I have always loved this place so much .
this place has got everything that a good restaurant consists of .
I had heard quite a bit about this place , so decided to visit it on the special occasion of our anniversary .
I must say , it was better than I had hoped for .
a great place for a date .
a great place for a date .
Could do much better .
AWESOME .
Had been here for a team lunch , nothing great to write about .
It was my first visit and it was a great experience .
overall a good experience .
but u hate the fact that they always run out of my favourites on the menu .
I do remember having enjoyed my meal and the experience , overall .
So , my recommendation is : Go 
d place is great ...
i mean u jus dnt realise dat u hav enterd a small lane in bandra lookin @ hw spacious d restaurant is 
If you ' re looking for a great meal without any budget constraints - this is the place to go to 
I remember the first time I visited here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were full to our heads 
Must must must visit - the variety , the presentation , the staff - brilliant 
And don ' t forget to reserve at least 10 days ( pfft ) in advance to get a table 
All in all , one of my favourite restaurants in Bombay 
And NO - IT ISNT OVERRATED 
loved it 
Not a big waoowww...
if you have visited the Barbeque Nation outlets in other cities like Mumbai or Chennai , you can notice great difference in food menu , ambiance etc .
Over hyped..
Def going back there again .
all that you were missing from Mumbai is now in Gurgaon .....
Have been going to Rajinder Da DHABA for about 12 years now and I haven ' t seen a place with so much rush of customers .
Superb 
Overall this place is Good and worth trying .
GULATI is the Best choice in the Pandara Road cluster of restaurants .
............
Rocking place .
Think about this...
by far my favorite place in cyber - hub and i never miss an opportunity to suggest it as the place to eat well Oh Calcutta is also there ....
people go eat and let them fight it out 
but let me tell you it's worth it .
plus it wasn't that crowded as i 
but i find this place decent enough to hang around .
Overall a good restaurant in the area .
very Innovative 
Over all I enjoyed the food and would love to go again .
Guys u do a good Job there .
Ideal place to be in with freinds....
Thursday a good day to go .
But I ' d be lying if I didn ' t say that there is an element of hype to the legend .
What a place to celebrate ur birthday .
Awesome restaurant which is mewly opened in C.P and it is by warehouse .
if you are into indulging in fine - dining sorts one night , do go here .
Been here with Friends 1.5 yr back .
Quite pleasant experience it was .
..Would like to visit soon in winters...
Still the best place for me in Taj 
It was a let down 
i been in luv wth nandos frm newzealand .
unfortunately , i decided to celebrate my birthday there 
didn't want to spoil my mood that night so we didn't leave a negative feedback after dinner , 
i had heard so much about this place , that i just had to try it .
This place has been my hangout for a long long time .
Though i wont rate it too high , its a place best visiting for all .
it couldn't get any better .
Must try .
it's the best place to be on Saturday nights .
been to this place ......
Cool to hang out with friends .
Its a must visit place .
Its different from other normal restaurants .
Surely a place to visit .
Just too good .
Don ' t miss out .
Fantabulous 
This is a jewel hidden under the big names like dominos , pizza hut etc .
Mostly groups of collegiate can be seen over here .
When we reached , we were told by the concierge on the ground floor that we might not find a free table and the place is full , but were free to go check - and we did .
Yauatcha is easily one of my favourite restaurants .
Having been a regular there since its inception , I try out at least one new dish each time I dine there , and have still not managed to try everything thanks to its vast menu .
Maintaining consistency is no easy task and they have mastered its art .
I give Yauatcha a full 5.0 Rating because it delivers fantastic food , great service , a wonderful ambience with comfortable seating and ample parking .
Would recommend this to anyone and everyone 
..Definitely will come back soon 
Good job 
Will recommend it to others 
Everything about this place was right .
Cheers 
the place is good ....
definate must have 
...ALL ARE SUPERB....
Overall not a nice experience .
very good place .
No doubt HRC has a cult following throughout the world .
This is seriously vintage .
The popularity of this place has only increased with time unlike 99 % of places in Delhi which get outdated within a couple of years .
A must visit 
So , its a romantic place .
You have greenery around .
A place to be for fun evening .
A must visit place .
But beyond this , the place is just above average .
Didn ' t expect this .
Romantic .
Refreshing .
I had never seen anything like dat .
There are scooters parked mainly and you will have to stand and have your food which is the main reason why people prefer take away .
The only problem this place has is lack of proper arrangements for people to have their food .
Romantic fr sure 
Unnecessarily hyped place 
Definitely an awesome fine dine modern food eating experience .
They should be reserving only a selected number of tables in advance and leave the rest for walk in guests .
Must try once 
Superb 
this place is very famous..though i guess a bit over rated .
..
Well , I had done my share of research before I went to Chandigarh , found this place happening and it indeed was .
Love it .
It was our 7th / 8th visit .
this is just a mini version of bbq nation .
not that good ..
One hell of a place to eat .
Been here a few times already and this place has never been a let down .
So it is a great place for peaceful date .
place is again huge so no worries for seat without reservation .
BETTER THAN MOST OF THE BIG NAMES LIKE PIZZA HUT , DOMINOS ETC .
kUDDOS TO THE OWNER .
The perfect place for a sports fan .
If you ' re a sports fan , this is the place to go .
But I guess that ' s the price we have to pay to have a ball , that said it ' s a great place to hangout with friends .
Nice place to hangout and enjoy with friends .
Especially liked the way they have tried to make maximum utilisation of the property by keeping it intact .
This is an amazing place .
the parties are good as well .
i had done party ' s many time ' s in TL and that was good experience 
This has been my 4th attempt to reserve a table for 2 , and have not been successful .
overall gud 
This place is going places pretty soon .
AER Four Season top the list .
Great place to visit at any time of the day .
Go out and make your special day even more special here .
The first thing came out fgrm m y mind when i enter there is " WOWWW " .
Must go place i must sayyyyy 
5 / 5 rating .
been here before .
please improve the standard .
i would prefer to go to some other restaurant .
Quite satisfactory nd a must visit place .
..
finally had an opportunity to visit this place which had been a very prominent feature of Connaught Place .
My first visit to townhouse and am glad i went there .
rating is just minus 
This place has been on my wishlist for a long time now .
A fun place to chill out at any point of the day .
Very urban and chilled out .
Liked whats dome with the place .
Nothing gr8 
I completely feel this place works on 2 things hype & amp ; PR .
Surprisingly , the entire restaurant was empty and we were the only ones at 9 : 30PM .
Awesome everything .
Loved it 
But overall a great place .
the place was also good for the any celebration.
I may not go again , considering that there are a zillion options around .
The staircase to this place on first floor of N block , outer circle , CP would give you an impression that it is some regular and tiny place .
The best time to visit this place is after 11.
This place is buzzing .
Had been there quite a few times .
i also want try one time bottel chirmmy 
If you are planning on having fun , this definitely is NOT the place to go 
awesome ..
Visited this place last week with my wife to celebrate her birthday and was frankly disappointed by the overall experience .
Though our initial experience in terms of being ushered to our ( reserved ) table was good , unfortunately , that was the beginning of our disappointment .
While cost cutting is a good idea per se , being stingy is a different ball game altogether .
Last but not the least , if you looking for a quiet place to spend a romantic evening with a loved one , give this place a skip .
Until next time , adios..
The icing on the cake was the presence of around 100 - 200 bugs / mosquitoes at the same level as the food plates .
Lovely & amp ; awesome 
They should open their branches in other cities too .
..Good place 
All in all worth a visit .
but not the least the crowd was sexy ....
Great place for dinner date .
However the experience was neutral .
Good in olden days .
Now a shady joint 
Guess you guys are struck off my ever wanting to come to you list .
I was visiting delhi and I ' m so glad I came here 
Definitely a must visit if you are in this side of delhi 
He SAD She SAD 
..so choose wisely because you will b lucky if you ' d be able to switch seats .
Not sure y this is 2nd position in trending 
Nothing too good or too bad about it .
Appreciated .
All together I would call this place " a silent player " , came up silently as a surprise and doing quite good .
Shit Place .
could improve a lot .
.......
if there is one place that does not need any more reviews , its this one 
and its not hard to see why it is one of my favorite restaurants in Bangalore 
Smokehouse is one of the few places though that cant go wrong whatever they do 
Good place .
...Its simple....just d presence of a parsibaba restaurant in gurgaon makes me visit this place again and again .
....All in all a must visit ..
i visited on last sunday with my family ...
So , I prefer Skyye 
They r trying to hype up the place by showing off their attitude .
I can hardly comment anything negative on this place .
Went der at nyt around 9 bt had to wait till 10 for seats .
..but den i hear it is a famous place .
..cannot comment .
located at cyberhub It is one of the best restaurants in the city 
wow 
hoping to visit it soon again .
...don ' t go .
..you will be disappointed , But 
All in all I must say this is a place that i would recommend as a must visit .
ok food , ok place , ok staff , ok deco , just ok 
!seriously.....just ok .
To begin with sigree global grill is a perfect place for a food with good ambience .
Overall a pace worth visiting many times yo have good foos .
nice place .
bt overall nice experience 
Been there twice and must say it has been worth the visit .
Place gets full by 9 and by 11 things start to get crazy .
All and all a good place to party with your friends .
Had been one of our favorite haunts for the last decade or so .
...is a tremendous feeling that cannot be described in words , and probably that is why I would still visit the place in times to come .
Everything about Kaidi Kitchen is impeccable..
I loved it and plan to take my family there soon .
Ohk place not so nice 
Nice place to hang out 
the Outdoor seating which i was not very much comfortable , where on one side of the table they had soft cushion seating and on the other side chairs made from steel .
...will be back 
I have been here many times and every time it has been a GOOD experience .
Perfect weekend place to be .
..
Girls can hv a blast 
Classy place for a perfect romantic date .
best meal had in a long long time .
My family is huge fan of this restaurant nd we manage to dine here atleast twice a month 
I have had friends and family telling me that if they went there without a reservation , they were given a table , but i was refused bookings seven days in advance too 
Huge fun n good restaurant .
I wanna dinner so my frnd rcommended to go to alimentosAnd I got a prfrct restaurant 
It was just fine .
I will definitely go back here every time I ' m in CP 
Awesome place .
we hardly find a parsi restaurant in apni dilli , hence the novelty factor and the waiting time .
Such a beautiful place in one of the most breathtaking forts in this country .
All in all , a must visit for everyone who goes to Jaipur 
First look amazing .
Crowded place .
sunday evening , a company of good friends , open terrace and some leaisure time at disposal .
!My friends n I were very hungry and happened to visit this place on a Saturday afternoon .
We came to this place and it was quite awesome .
monkey bar actually takes the buck if you really want to chill ...
any day recommended for a place to chill out ...
This restaurant is my favourite list .
I did not expect this place to be quite upmarket until I reached there .
This place surely attracts one of the best crowd from the city .
The right time to hit the place is 11 pm on weekends .
.maintained their standard since forever.
A place to go with your loved one .
Just the place to be at if you ' re looking for a rather romantic / cozy date night with your special someone 
They ' re amazing 
Went here with my beau and we loved everything 
Must visit if you have a minimum of 3 - 4 hours to spare 
If you are looking for a table on saturday night and a happening place .
This is the place to be .
A fantastic place to visit : ) 
Went here on a Saturday evening and had to wait for about an hr .
Definitely worth it 
Amazing place .
And ( like us ) you may forgiven to think that the name implies another cafe like lounge that serves beer towers to the gypsy twenties - something socialite .
On the top floor of a still unfinished commercial building is The Mughsot Lounge .
Very good place .
superb 
This places impresses on many fronts .
Thus , you can have your peace of mind and your conversations with no external factor playing a role .
Accidentally stepped in to Khaan Saab and what a pleasant surprise it was 
A view of green bangalore from 13th floor is a feast for eyes .
One can see green bangalore from here .
Liked it 
An apt place for having a nice romantic date .
Not that bad and not that good .
Its one tym going restaurant...?
Joeys is a small place .
..but don ' t go by its size , oh no 
Definitely going to visit this place soon 
When you are here , you are at the 35th floor .
A must visit place 
Perfect place to spend a peaceful evening with your partner .
I just want to visit this place every weekend 
Great cafe .
cyber hub definitely has better joints .
wouldn't want to back unless it's someone else's treat .
Will visit again : ) loved it 
it was decent 
but could definitely improve .
Four of us went to Smoke House Deli sometime back simply because the reviews were great and we had heard so much about the place .
Great experience : ) 
All in all a very pleasant experience would definitely come back .
Found the place to be vet lively for a Monday evening .
Mugshot is inside jewel square mall which is still not renovated completely .
This place is really well done .
But guys the msg is not welcome : ( 
Just awsome 
if you want to Lighten up your mood in the middle of a hectic day at work ...
this is the place to be in Cyber Hub 
Definitely must visit if you are in Hyderabad .
.not great .
All in all a good place to hangout .
Their happy hours too are quite convenient to enjoy .
Brilliant place to chill and have a good time .
My favourite hangout in Mumbai .
Really wanted to visit this place since long and was really excited about it too .
But as it turned out , the place is not that exciting afterall .
I went there on tuesday night around 7 : 30 .
That was a disappointment .
That is one thing you cannot miss after visiting this place .
The place could not stand up to my expectations and it was disappointing .
...
Personal party @ the M - floor : being away from the main floor service was a challenge , air con sucks..
Its the best to go in winter..
Never disappoints you 
Overall pathetic experience 
Wasn ' t that grt experience for me .
What more do you need for a special dinner .
This place can easily be for the lovebirds in the city .
Preferable time is night .
Awesome experience .
Some of tye servers were also the same when I saw them ages back when I was a kid and use to come with my mom dad , will love to go back tyere again and again and again 
I love it .
Heard about Masala Library from a friend and have been wanting to go for ages 
I would recommend everyone try this place out 
It is always filled so one needs to have some time and patience in hands before going there .
I am horrified by hotmillion .
This day will haunt me forever .
to me its a brand 
Man - this is easily in my top 5 restaurants in Mumbai .
If you haven ' t been to Yauatcha - I envy you - because you are in for a real treat 
Mozarella , name sounds nice .
And it holds true in this case .
If you visit this place on NEw Year day , trust me you may not be able to place order as the the flood of foodies is at its peak extending to the main road .
Mark this place on your wish list .
The place is so crowded that you may feel as if people have gathered for a mass ( especially in evening ) .
I have been to this place many many times and it is always a delight and worth the travel .
The gate opened and it felt like we ' re stepping into some other world .
I saw a lot of pizza boxes piled up besides the tables where we sat .
Better than Domino ' s and Pizza Hut .
Had an awful experience at this place .
I never expected this type of mistake from such a big and popular restaurant .
Will not recommend it to anyone .
An awesome place for a group of friends to hangout .
also the place is so out of town , if you are going here for first time plz make sure you know the address well .
plz plz avoid going here .
Was excited ( not anymore ) to be at this place EXOTICA .
Yautcha is easily the top three Restaurants in Bombay for me .
Have been there around 20 times and never been dissapionted .
Thank you for keeping the standards .
Its a nice place .
Grt place .
The best in market , try it once before you die : ) 
Cheers , 
If in Delhi , visit this place once , then visit it again and again .
One hell of an amazing place ?
overhyped ..
A Must visit place .
Just one word Amazing 
if you are going there on weekends may the luck be with you .
we waited more than half an hour to get a table for 3 .
The place is just amazing .
You will find young people of the age group 18 - 26 which makes it a very happening place .
I would recommend you to go early here on d weekends as it gets really full very fast 
My overall experience here was good 
Have been to Atmosphere 6 a couple of times with family and friends .
Plus , I LLOOOOVVEE Starbucks to the core .
I can have it anytime anyday 
I wont ever get bored of it .
Still , good to try .
Try this outlet .
It might become your favorite ; ) 
The restaurant shall evaluate making portions for one person only along with decreasing the rates .
a must try if u r in kolkata 
Every thing is supervised to meet the high standards set .
Go without any expectations , and you ' ll step out with a big smile and fond memories .
Horrible place 
This place is just not worth it 
They ' d do better to replace the entire management , chefs and the menu and start from scratch..
I visited here just few days back on my engagement anniversary day and I would say I really had a wonderful time here .
I would definitely visit again .
All the readers do visit 
.i loved the creation .
sundays are usually over crowded ..
( not seen such mistakes in any restaurant ) .
been seeing this and wanted to visit , as its a huge place with 5 floors .
2nd floor and 3rd are meant for buffet and regular sitting .
the buffet space was little congested .
Celebrated my birthday over here with my bunch of frenz n had the best bday ever 
Apart from the name nothing is good .
the fact that it is a non air conditionedand has no music is a bit of a turn off for me .
its very classy .
a two - level seating , indoors and outdoors .
for me the place to sit is on the upper floor ....................
An ok kind of place .
Pretty small I will say .
It is right next to the station , so isn ' t really well placed .
Pretty small I will say .
We hopped in here to celebrate a friends birthday and it was amazing .
I have been here before with some colleagues .
We loved being here .
It really pinched me the money I wasted in Urban Asia .
It ' s just show off and I would say " All fart and no shit " .
If you want just show off and don ' t bother about the taste then Urban Asia is a the place .
Pathetic .
A must go place .
.Overall I ' ll rate 4.5 out of 5 .
A place to be if u wanna have a gooood time 
Alwayz satisfying .
A good place for family 
Love this place 
It never disappoints .
classy  
Been on my wish - list for a while .
This place scores even before entering inside , the Blue door it is 
Thumbs Up & amp ; Cheers 
its determinately a restaurant that we will come back to ...
first class !.
Great experience .
Finding Olive Bistro is tough .
This restaurant is not elderly - friendly ( way too many steps to climb ) .
Olive Bistro did not impress at all .
Never going back to this place again 
The worst part of it all were the flies .
There were flies everywhere .
You know like one of those cozy , nice little places where you n your school / college gang hang out most often .
Our one hour lunch quickly became three hours .
Would recommend.
; I would recommend this to a friend .
Much enjoyment was had at High Ultra Lounge .
Have been to this place twice .
Moreover , this is also your ticket to see Mumbai ' s real estate situation personified - cramped seating , limited space to move around .
Yeah , that bad .
Moreover , this is also your ticket to see Mumbai ' s real estate situation personified - cramped seating , limited space to move around .
To sum it up it ' s a wonderful place to go especially with that special someone .
the whole team , front and back stage created a wonderful experience which matched our first visit and we look for ward to returning .
With a so hyped name nothing great about it .
soda bottle opener wala is a very different place and concept .
its perfect for an outing with friends .
Have been to this place a couple of times .
Since its a restaurant serving cuisine that ' s not available everywhere except a few places in Mumbai and parsi households , it already gets some points from my side .
i went to plan b on a friday for lunch .
its not really a big place , not very small either .
it was almost full when we got there .
overall i just loved plan b and i will be visiting again in future .
The perfect romantic place .
Had visited several times and experience is foodilecious visit by visit .
Nice experience @ sanyam aggarwal 
best candle light dinner in Bangalore .
but again not that great .
If you stay in Mumbai and not visited this place , you are definitely missing out on something amazing .
We went for a Friends Birthday .
Everything was totally Amazing .
Completely PACKED 
That alone is enough for time spent there .
always crowded ...
been there on a Sunday - it was full .
there are better places if you are looking for pan Asian food .
I love this place .
Only positive things to say 
This was not accepted from a hotel of the class of Marriott .
Very close to the airport and far for people in the Vaishali Nagar area but the place is so good that the distance doesn ' t matter .
Great place to go for special occasions .
Keep up the good work 
yes , on the weekends as well ..
Well , let ' s say it is a famous place .
I would definitely recommend if you intend to sit outside , else avoidable.
The inside section is too dark and dingy for my liking .
we went here for my birthday party .
i thought it to be just another lounge .
proved me wrong .
this is the place everyone would like to visit .
One of my favourite haunts .
Had been here twice with colleagues .
well done .
Nice .
but that was also very unsatisfactory .
.would highly recommend to those who love to EAT DRINK AND TALK at the same time .
..Would love to visit again very soon .
, truffles always come to my mind.
the oly disadvantage is the crowd here .....
thou i had to wait for almost the length of a T20 game , 3 1 / 2 hrs , to get in ; it was worth the wait .
i hope the concerned authorities do make a note of this .
A good place .
...
The entrance of this place smells like anything 
its snugly located in ra Puram and looks very cozy .
As the name goes , it really is rocky .
I don ' t think you ' ll regret it .
...overall is a good place of eating out .
Terrific place with just about the right mix of everything 
Apart from this point it was a pretty decent experience .
After months of hearing about Cyber hub - I finally made it there .
After a bit of initial survey , we decided to try Soda Bottle Openerwala .
A nice place .
Recommended for once .
..
..
..One must try this for the legacy..
They got it all .
.Been visiting pandara road since i was a kid..
And every visit was a great experience .
first of all thank you # Zomato for letting me know about Shanghai Salsa .
okay 
it was okay .
Awesome place for a corporate outing..
Surely going there again soon 
totaallyyy a funn visit..!!! 
Will surely visit soon .
went today to the legendary karim @ jama Masjid ..
can go once 
but certainly not the place to go again n again .
I was very excited to go for the first time but I wasn ' t very impressed .
Crowd was so so good .
Crowd was so so good .
Each item has been carefully documented and labelled , and every single piece is of significance as it had belonged to legends from the world of rock .
This is one of the oldies in Delhi .
Can try it out once .
i took my family to the restaurant and couldn't take not more than one in the lift it was very small and scary .
Considering that it ' s a well settled chain , all such key aspects must be looked into .
Overall a fine place for a good evening .
A perfect place to spend your evening .
Suggestion : take a stroll before selecting a seat .
recently we went here with office mates .
we enjoyed a lot .
good Work Barbeque nation 
Place is so crampy .
If you around CP , must visit this place .
Try it here .
To go place to impress to someone who you really want to impress 
The place is very to locate just near the Amphitheater in Cyberbub .
huge cafe ..
mostly crowded ..
I ' ll give full points to this place .
Awesome place .
Double thumb up .
we have visited bukhara restaurant around middle of august and we were happily surprised .
nice.
NEVER go here 
only name no nothing 
And couldn ' t believe it was full of crowd .
right from Start to the End everything was Perfect .
tummy Full ...
though they were packed both times .
I ' ve been to this place about 6 - 7 times and have enjoyed the experience everytime .
Its one of my top options when visiting cyber hub .
The gentry is always very much mixed .
Good 
A place really close to my heart .
Lots of talking and eating to do : ) 
Sitting in the waiting area with my grandparents with an estimated wait of one hour duration .
The reviews promise it should be worth the wait .
Damn hope it is 
Customer alert : be careful if you are coming on a Sunday .
However , this never happened during my innumerable visits to BYD before .
Idiots 
Excellent .
....still feeling rejuvenated to visit one more time .
...classic place to hangout..
Thank u 
A place for ppl who are hungry fr ambeince plus silence altghr while on dinning with frends and family 
Went on friday late evening , was crowed as expected .
Went on friday late evening , was crowed as expected .
Probably need to check the place after 5 - the dhaba part opens in the eve only .
Over rated .
What ' s obviously missing is for this city to allow the best ever chain to serve beer and cocktails .
That ' s HRC pretty much anywhere in the world .
Great place to hang - out on weekends .
I was here with my friends to grab some bites .
Every one should visit this outlet at least once 
One of my most visited hunger point .
Had been there a couple weeks .
I jus feel in luv with the place .
Overall good experience .
Good place for a Friday \ Saturday night .
Cool 
This one lived up to my expectations 
Absolutely loved it .
May be next time 
i went there on s Saturday afternoon , thinking it would be deserted , 
but to my surprise it was buzzing with loads of people .
it was good to see everyone having a great time there .
would be back to hrc 
one of the Best hrc in India .
would be back to hrc 
I always loved the Karim ' s in Jama Masjid .
I simply love this place .
I will surely visit this place again : - D 
Overall it was a fair experience .
My home away from home 
I ' ll never visit Gurgaon without spending as many evenings as possible here .
Had to wait for like an hour to enter and the wait was worth the wait .
Good experience .
Must visit place .
It is rather one of my favourite joints out there in CP .
In short , I loved the place and its a nice spot to sit and chill out with friends / Family .
The over hyped place in village dese days .
V ol happily enter .
But then upon entering also , we are asked to wait for another 5 min so that the people sitting before us can pay their bill .
Overall my rating - 2.5 / 5Keep socialising ppl 
A nice place to go for a drink with friends .
Do not visit during monsoon as there are a lot of insects during that time and the food doesn ' t seem very hygienic .
If you want a quick bite and eat snacks , HM is a good option .
Its an awesome place for Family and friends get together , sitting arrangements on a large Round tables makes food more enjoyable so as the interaction with your mates .
I ' ll simply awesome once again .
Its just awesome : - )
