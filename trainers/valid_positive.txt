even though nandos remain quite occupied everytime i go , there is no doubt about the flaw less service these guys offer !
the succulent chicken in store is always a delight to have !
We ordered the Peri peri chicken and chicken breast fillet wrap along with rosa fresca .
Other than that the staff was polite but were not able suggest anything from the menu .
I am rating it a 3.5 because of the very average experience we had .
I would recommend a chicken butterfly for a lone meat - eater , but a chicken platter if you have someone to share with - - the Piri - piri is very very good .
best possible chicken preparations...at least not like boiled chicken pieces in some shady gravy which is the so called trend here .
I have since graduated to Bloody Mary and LIIT which are both well made at HRC .
The Burgers , especially the Chicken Burger is Huge and yummy .
I wasn ' t disappointed and felt that most of these burgers can be a part of the regular menu .
If you like chicken , And only one place you could go in Delhi for Dinner , With friends , or with someone new to the city , or even aloneThis is it .
I ordered a chicken burger called ' 12 ' .
The funky decor and THE PERI PERI chicken makes it a must visit .
The non veg platter offers melt - in - mouth galauti kebabs , fish and my favourite mutton burra to name a few .
Amritsari fish : I found it to be too average .
Laas maas for me is characterised by the flavour of coriander powder and typical rajasthani chillies with an underline signature of garlic and cloves .
Garlic naan : Was just average and no big shakes about it .
Average desserts .
the chicken tikka tandoori will blow you away .
.as we like less spicy food !
Magaj Masala - Chicken baked with green herbs , topped with poppy seeds .
Plain simple food .
I ordered the chicken tikka , a lassi , and some naan .
A must visit if you like chicken
As they say , chicken is well marinated.... well .
... Guys ill be visiting again and again and again !
We had 1 / 4 the chicken in mild peri peri sauce and the moroccan burger with fillet .
Order was served quickly as usual .
Also tried the chicken strips on rice , decent flavor .
The chicken is their signature dish , and is always very consistent inflavour n taste .
Go for butterfly chicken , you can grab a citrus bliss too for drink .
They have ample staff and the order also does ' nt make you wait long .
Amazing chicken !
Peri peri chicken yum !
Wat a chicken...!!!
The peri peri chicken is the best chicken tasted by mee mixed with secret sauces which makes you go .
Food is really nice specially Dark Rum chicken , Chicken Saffron , Paella ( Spanish Dish ) , Chicken steak etc .
Advantages of the place : - Place is cozy .
We had the Asian sampler and a few Thai inspired curries .
We ordered chicken tikka , dal bukhara and chicken khurchan .
We ended up ordering the Daal , tandoori shimla mirch , naan , Kiwi mojito and cold drinks .
Not so expensive .
While the non - vegetarians were all praise for the food , other vegetarians and I found the preparation average ; portions were generous .
The Hunan Chicken was also tasty .
when it comes to mughlai cuisine , this place can seriously give Karim ' s a run for its money .
The Kebabs seem to have a slight tangy taste , which may be because of the Jamphal... ( which is one of the ingredients that goes in the mix ) .
They have everything fresh , everything seems like a mini gourmet version of the old bakeries they have strewn around the city , some of those are quite disappointing .
Eg : Rainbow Cake , chocolThere are however few options for people who prefer eggless food .
So i ordered a large chicken burger an my friend ordered nachos .
I ' d say , if you had to take your office colleagues or your ' serious ' uncle along , I would recommend this place .
The moment you enter you can actually smell the Peri Peri chicken flavors .
Their peri - peri chicken is fabulous .
The flesh is tender and juicy , and the marinated flavours really get soaked in the chicken to the bone .
Taste - Chicken 4.0 .
The signature piri piri chicken and drink is the USP .
one of finest chicken I ' ve ever had , pocket friendly too .
Had tried their peri peri chicken for the first time way back in 2010 in Canada and was all in tears from the spicey marinate .
They have kept their marinate as it actually is in the other parts of the world .
Fresh and tasty chicken .
They have a new dish ; called Esparada ( chicken tikka ) !
But once you enter the place , you will find it every bit of your money spent , just for the ambience .
We ordered some smoothies and crisp corn and chilly chicken and they were good .
Kentucky fried chicken : a haven for any chicken lover .
Take my advice ; visit the place once in a month so that you don ' t get bored .
Taste is above average .
