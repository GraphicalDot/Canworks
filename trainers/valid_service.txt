Always my choice to catch up with old friends, boogieing to their YMCA dance is an added attraction!
Other than that the staff was polite but were not able suggest anything from the menu .
I suppose it ' s more of a touristy destination since right when we sat down the waiter asked where we were from.
The waiter had initially served me a veg burger but before I could take a bite she realized the mistake and brought the correct one .
I wonder what would have happened if a vegetarian was served a chicken burger .
Twice , I was asked if I liked the food .
It looks they are in real hurry and serves dishes so fast as if you have to vacate the seat for more guests .
One the other hand they take lot of time to serve liquor .
Moreover , veg snacks were not at all served to the ones who opted for Non - veg.and when we asked to repeat a starter , they said its finished !
The serve fantastic food and if you haven ' t eaten here yet then you are really missing out .
Bonus : they keep all their food in those nice food trays with tea light underneath to keep everything warm .
That ' s a nice touch .
.Dhananjay is brilliant !
I saw our waiter 3 times : 5 minutes after we were seated to take our drink order , 10 minutes later to take our dinner order , and 10 minutes after we finished eating and started staring at the ceiling .
... tried to catch up for dinner... and waiting line just put me off !
Snails crawl faster.2.
A requested and confirmed dish was overlooked and not served ( not charged too ) .
Shows little attention towards the guests .
Order was served quickly as usual .
Be prepared for long queues on weekends .
You can always expect to get good food in a short waiting time .
..15 minutes to bring the menu card .
.. once I ordered... a Beer - corona... it takes another 9mins for them to bring it that too without the lemon wedge which I believe every restaurant in India offers .
.. another 5 mins to bring the lemon... which is now bigger than what can fit into the bottle .
I went there on a busy Saturday evening when the waiters and managers are quite busy shuffling dishes from table to table .
The staff and service could be better in terms of ambient noise.
So we had to wait longer for it .
