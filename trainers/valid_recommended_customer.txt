" Hookah " was well prepared .
The word itself gives you a sense of Richness and a feeling of classyness .
Found this place by accident after overhearing people talk about it during the Light & amp ; Sound show at the Amer fort and thank goodness for that !
I wanna dinner so my frnd rcommended to go to alimentosAnd I got a prfrct restaurant
After months of hearing about Cyber hub - I finally made it there .
The cab guy recommended butter chicken and so I had it .
However , this never happened during my innumerable visits to BYD before .
Went there post reading some reviews on Zomato.. And turned out to be an inspired choice .
I would love to go for the brunch which looked really promising .
Definitely for a romantic dinner .
!must go place .
Think about this... .
We were taken to this restaurant be a local friend in Jaipur....You enter the place and the music and seating take you be awe .
Overall , MUST have the Jerk Chicken !
You must have this if you are visiting Replay .
Good place , must visit for sweet lovers .
!Give dis place a chance .
..hav a feel good feelin inside u as well .
the bar area and the dance floor are pretty cool , worth a visit for sure !
nd services are really good but you should go at least 3 hrs before closing because one would love to spend time a lot there ...
amazing food must try
recomended from my side ...
so thumbs up with recommendations .
prior reservation is recommended .
a reservation is highly recommended at all times .
im definitely going back again : )
over all a must go for food enthusiast .
tip for tummy : watch out for the spicy ones , they do burn !
a must try in Guwahati !
i think it would be a safe choice to skip this place .
would never like to visit this place again neither will recommend others to visit this place ....
i suggest to go there at lunch ..
highly recommended ..
overall a must visit place .
the corner seat by the glass panel window is a nice place to see the hitech city
good Italian food option in Hyderabad .
would recommend for buffet & amp ; service is also good .
any day recommended for a place to chill out ...
this is the place everyone would like to visit .
we had a reservation so got a place to sit .
a must eat.
if you haven't been there yet , a definite must - visit for dinner .
highly recommended , for the privacy , care , and off course some good acid jazz sitting in the tent .
but if you have the taste for it , you should try it .
you start with long waiting time outside ,
can't miss this if you are in Delhi for a filling & amp ; tasty meal .
:( go early get seats
it is recommended especially for families because outside you will find all over families waiting for their turn to enter in restaurant .
:to avoid waiting please visit around 8 to 830 pm because after that there is long waiting of 1 or 2 hours majorly in weekends .
overall a must go place .
i would recommend this place if you want to go out with friends to chill & amp ; enjoy your lunch with great selection of drinks .
simply awesome must try
but again you should really go there for the food .
a great place to hang out with friends or loved ones .
must try !
all in all this makes a must visit food joint reccomended by me .
a personal recommendation here is the spring vegetable pasta , accompanied with a fresh river sole with lemon and herb gremolata .
:getting close to nature should also mean being sensible enough to wear a mosquito repellant patch .
also , reservations are highly recommended .
a must visit place to hangout with friends and family too
must try .
go empty stomach .
suggestion take a reservation it can be crowded and waiting could take long .
by far my favorite place in cyber - hub and i never miss an opportunity to suggest it as the place to eat well Oh Calcutta is also there ....
people go eat and let them fight it out
a must try place with friends .
