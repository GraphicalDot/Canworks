" Hookah " was well prepared .
The word itself gives you a sense of Richness and a feeling of classyness .
Found this place by accident after overhearing people talk about it during the Light & amp ; Sound show at the Amer fort and thank goodness for that !
I wanna dinner so my frnd rcommended to go to alimentosAnd I got a prfrct restaurant
After months of hearing about Cyber hub - I finally made it there .
The cab guy recommended butter chicken and so I had it .
However , this never happened during my innumerable visits to BYD before .
Went there post reading some reviews on Zomato.. And turned out to be an inspired choice .
I would love to go for the brunch which looked really promising .
Definitely for a romantic dinner .

We were taken to this restaurant be a local friend in Jaipur....You enter the place and the music and seating take you be awe .
Overall , MUST have the Jerk Chicken !
