Me and my Frnd were the only customers last night for dinner .People at first even I was like " whats the point of having bengali food outside home ?i'm eating here as i write ..! gotta go i was told that there was no queue and waiting time since it was a Tuesday when a lot of people in northern India abstain from non veg food .too bad they have been shutting early lately ! starting with the ambience ..and bar ( if possible ) not necessary ...You won ' t feel like you ' re in Pune .opens for people around 11 or so and the biryani is brought from their kitchen in a huge drum and the ghee is mixed in front of the crowd .their are other items too !! ! We were at Jaipur on a short visit , 11 to 14.07 .2014 , stayed right across this Kanha outlet at the : Sheraton hotel ..Order booked at 11 : 40pmReceived hot food at 12 : 15am .: ) saturday night .......pure Punjab is a restaurant .interior nothing out of the box , with two accolades from - zomato & amp ; toi gleaming onto the wall ..food Unsure why this place is trending in the top list .al olwayswhenevr i hit bkp there is one thing olways peeking out of mah mind ..its too less over here ..but for some reason or the other could not make it .at last i made it l here last week .Going out with friends and no new place to go ..finally we got a place inside the restaurant ...try to let it not piss you off .i had already heard of this place from my friends during my college days .but ultimately gathered some courage and entered the place .Went to the restaurant on a sunday afternoon .was in Kalyani for a few days and heard a lot about this place .but you gotta stand in a line for a Biriyani take away ...Now what to say about Batman .Batman has solution for all your problems .al though i didn't feel that great as it's shown in pics .have been to Hyatt in Bombay :) .I don ' t know where is the DEN for this BATMAN but sure it delivered food .Coming to the food .The funniest part is you can ask the delivery guy , " Are you BATMAN ?HAHA yet to taste other dish of it .i hope , others will be good too .somehow i have been to this place just twice , inspite of its proximity to my place .probably that's one criterion that scores decent points .comprehensive review regarding dining experience will be put up by the end of the day  this review will be a consolidated one of my all visits ., .?local of 7 years now ..So my best bet would be to order at home alright , let me just say that people often form their opinions based on what they hear about a place and not by the actual food .my opinion , let me assure you , is free from from all such influences .is it true ?it had a mix of pretty much everything around the world .at this point , i was quite interested to what would be put out in the plates .but of course at this time , i still hadn't tasted their food so i couldn't have known if it was worth the wait .you go at 0000 hrs and you can still get an entry to have food in there .their worst part ! a special note for the owners ..Rest of the factors are ok .We went for a reunion and one of had a fast that day , she was supposed to eat just fried potatoes with no salt .We were all amazed and it did not end there ....We went for a reunion and one of had a fast that day , she was supposed to eat just fried potatoes with no salt .! d this place is actually not in Kolkata but no one even looks at the menu .just on your micro - oven for 5mins ...its Just Not About Health , Wealth Or Driving a Benz And Entering Grand Or Park .its Something Which Makes Your Inner Heart Skip a Hundred Times .its Something Which Makes Your Inner Heart Skip a Hundred Times .Boom Pow Whoosh Uggh These pop ups are synonymous with the Batman series which used to come on TV .partying with friends ) , the house party will go on further for at least a couple of hours , the initial plates of biryani have been gobbled up in a jiffy and suddenly hunger strikes .Who should you call ?Batman Delivers .And apart from food , they have other stuff also which they can deliver .Although , I wish they had all the popular brands of cigarettes otherwise here it would have been a 5 star rating .Trust me , the Dark Knight has risen .mamu ..a name we fondly gave to the guy at the dairy close to xavier's ...keeping in mind the modest beginning they made .keeping up to the legacy and loyalty they have built up working in this field and literally starting from the scratch .can't blame the management for this ..! : ) what more can you ask for ?..Nothing to complain about ..! wen i first heard d name i laughed my gutts out .......Speciality in that ..Confuses at the first go ..one more from the Pandara road diary , and this one is also worth tasting .! After a couple of times i just decided to go hungry ..thumbs up for the founders..keep it up ..; ) but i hadn't heard about this place until the Friendships Day this year .but since i am not an orange person i went ahead for this one .so you may give it a try ...at all Go for it .Yesterday we three people went to have some gupshup and experience the food here .! the best thing here is don't check the menu at all ...We were a bunch of 10 friends out to have dinner , reservations were made before hand .Replay as seen and read about in the reviews here , was a little off as compared to it .! .! if you are a true lover of biryani ...?.I always passed frm this place ...Bt never visited it .Why they chose to hire him is beyond me .Only giving the 1.5 because I was shocked that they actually showed up .after the saavan fast got over i was eagerly waiting to have non veg .so planned to go to Gulati .firstly i want to point out that not every buffet style restaurant serve authentic food as it is prepared in large quantity for a large crowd .reached just before happy hours end We ordered some dears but they limit us to order only less because happy hour going to end .it didn ' t make sense to us .I went to celebrate my birthday with my friends .It was Saturday evening and we.it didn ' t make sense to us .and this is the reasom y i choose to give it a 4 and not 4.5 or 5 .comming down to the most important thing , food ..i had referred to the rating Zomato before going .Class of food .how cool is that ...air Cafe Lounge ..air Cafe Lounge ..! visited the place today after a long gap .I basically don ' t smoke and don ' t drink ..We almost spent 5 hours .they do allow people to have small celebrations like Birthday dinners which can be a little un settling at times as the people celebrating hardly consider about others having dinner there .the wall full of framed certificates display their excellence over the years .: D Want to try a new place ?! its hard to be in dis industry wid old name ....Took my team out to Air Cafe Lounge .Not sure if it qualifies as true Burmese but it felt like it was Indo / Chinese / Thai inspired .We went strictly by the waiter ' s recommendations ...! was very hungry so couldn't wait to click pictures .sorry p Lets start with getting a table .When i called them they wre booked for a friday nite but yet i thought of giving it a try .you cannot eat much Biriyani in Arsalan bcoz of that dalda ..Friends , post - dinner hunger thus shiv Sagar .! you are looking for joey's .....?About 20 of us had dinner here : ) ?Restaurant in town...i can't understand why people are rating it even 2 .! ..hav a feel good feelin inside u as well .place located in Andheri just ahead of juhu circle .making it perfect for students .food .only cons ! !!! ! maybe new setup get to suit ppl slowly ..it's one of those places ..nothing out of the place ...its in cp ..hit it on any lazy saturday or sunday for Lunch i must have passed by this place n number of times during the past 6 years , finally , yesterday i got a chance to visit this place with my Bosses and my client for an informal get together ..limited which is what speaks volumes about the ideology of the restaurant .But v got quickly as v were only two .in Delhi it is not easy to find the authentic indian restaurant any more .today the Indian food has been modernized to such an extent that it can actually be called fusion food .if one has a craving for a modernized take on the Indian cuisine then there is no shortage of restaurants .butter and was just falling apart .caution ! Location : Main Tonk Road near the Rambagh Circle .It was not what we had in mind .Is Batman so Garib in India .Man man man ! Getting up to the restaurant is a task though .Somehow it slept out of my mind and I called them at two in afternoon for table booking .They were closed for any bookings but they asked us to reach by 7.30 so that we will be getting table .Me and my brother reached and for our surprize there were only few table left to be filled .first of all , i am delighted ( and also very much surprised ) to see 'Dada Boudi ' in Zomato now when it's here , i can't refrain myself from reviewing it .here what only matters is the food.last week we went there after four long years and when we came out we could only say HIGH .! ! !U Can visit if a big Foodie ; ) Walked in on a Friday night to find the place bustling with people all ready to get their drink on ...got really packed post 1...few starlets nd strugglers hanging around on d edge of d dancefloor...bachelorette parties ..bdays...nd kitty party aunties out dancing was the general type of crowd that night ...Thanks Sudeep fr the tour nd the absolutely amazing pizza.but also locals , perhaps on a 50 - 50 proportion .cp has been really surprising me with the sizes of the restaurants .i but however so far i have discovered that it is the contrary .I booked a table for dinner and specified them that we are 10 adults and 2 children .The person sitting at the end of the table had to pass his glass to the waiter serving water .This review is for Pirates of Grill , Rajouri Garden .Their is something special about the whole pandara road market and nearby khan market .That it is located in the posh area of Delhi only adds to the whole experience .just one tip Because of great weather only the outside area was operational .The place started filling at 10 : 30 as the entry is less before 11pm .I had initially planned to eat pao bhaji , but she explained that they are a franchise soon becoming a self owned place , named nini ' s kitchen .The franchise had asked them to make pre - cooked pao bhaji and they rebelled and now they could work on their own terms .And I wonder what they would do with the graffiti that has juice lounge written all over it .though .i have been here once .following are my rating I have been a regular customer of this place since 2001 .I might be unlucky to get these ...! :) love it ...then ...BonAppetite : - ) @ !! ...Though I am writing this review a bit late ...But as it is said it is better late than never..I hosted a party for 30 pax .I asked them the reason for it they said that they have a bar which is near the dining area ( got d hint dat this place is basically for drinking and not for food ) .Requested them to allow us with the child as it was too early and would leave the place in a hour .Ka bhaiyya who was hired a few days back ...I miss that place so much .But unfortunately it ' s place has been taken by GARBAGE ' 69 ( no pun intended ) Management u can argue on dis m game ...cauz u ' ll r just fooling ppl .Gulati...!!! ! How do i know ?.It came it my name written on it .it was a Sunday eve ..i had been their with my family ..! The poor things who are raving about these dishes havent had the chance to taste the authentic stuff.i happened to grab a Groupon voucher as i was on a group meet up .That ' s what we did .I ' m not even kidding .This place was on my bucket list since a very long time .Finally got to have a taste of this place .reminds you of the time when you were a kid so if you are willing to experiment try it out with an open mind .although Bangalore doesn't have much of sky line .for some reason i was in the mood to splurge on food that day .first hoping that i can use my chopsticks right and then to see if i like this rubbery Cuttle fish ....go well covered , woolens if you can .cause its freezing up there .you are sure to catch a chill2 ..haven't been here in a while .The variety of breads and spreads on offer is really .Recommended ?.: ) ...Dey serve ! went there for lunch.then came the test .What more ?Choice of drinks ?my bday bash ....No kidding .The friend who offered to share this with you will say " oh that sounds like it ' ll be too heavy " .Trust me .You need to try this .You ' re killing me .although it is comparitively smaller than its other counterparts , when it comes to pizzas ...The place started to be fill in at around 11.00pm .We ordered our drinks and got chatting with the gentleman making our cocktails ( who we later realised was the owner ) .We just happened to go there one Saturday evening .Anyways let ' s get to the point .Food .Blimey ! ?: ) ?but this time we put up a fight .Lets rock @ Gangsta , Bandra near natioanl college ?...Came here for lunch today .Plus it was drizzling to add to the sheer beauty of the place .But if you truly want the place ' s true taste , try it having it outside .The place also has one more zone in the back of the enclave .And it surely is ..On a fine afternoon , me and colleagues were off with hectic schedule and thought to cool off with some good food : - ) Searched nearby places on Zomato and selected Pirates of Grill to be the place ....! Pal dhaba !!! Dil kush hota hai jab kuch dil ko touch kar jata hai though .:) Many a times I passed this place and couldn ' t go due to reasons .This time I went to drop my sister and squeezed some time to get a parcel .! ...the .This is a dog eat dog world .) .I went with high hope to this place .I had expected the appetizer to be fried with oil in it .We are supposed to visit another restaurant but came here as there was heavy public in that restaurant .1...Now the main matter the food .Bombay brasserie : * go empty stomach .!!! .went there for lunch ...We went to this place with high expectations .But owing to the fact that Bangalore does not have a skyline , the height is not utilised at all .A place at this height in Mumbai would have been much better .Go here This is probably the first hookah parlours ' in guwahati .If u want to hv good punjabi food around cp ......Lodi is ( obviously ) located on the lodi road , next to the Islamic Center near IHC .Ask them for suggestions Thankfully the weather was on our side as well We decided to sit inside .They noticed They opened , we got a table for 3.People tend to eat while drinking .So be proficient in ordering .Or else you will be carrying food back home Had been here on August 31st with my love for celebrating our 3rd anniversary .Ambience .Food .Thanks for that Went there on 5 September 2014 to celebrate the Teachers day .OK , I ' ll be honest ; I don ' t really remember what we ordered here .Zippr code : YAXE8298 ! !! Haha ! improve that and the outlet can be really good .god knows we made ourselves sit and placed our order ., ..............ding ding the two competitors in the ring .....i just entered this place randomly i couldn't try much of food that day .thought it would in late evening .may be it was more cz of my company , ......Thursday a good day to go .i had been wanting to go this place since a long time and i finally suggested this place to my cousins while we were deciding to go somewhere to dine .next visit is with husband .already planned ..however , here it is trust me , it's just The village .the bday gal said n i quote ! : D The only word that can define it .FANTASTIC Sunday afternoon ......! You have breeze around .What ?Are you kidding me ?It ' s just a gimmick to create hype .This is the only annoying part about this place .The best part came at the last ..May it be soccer , cricket , hockey .went there a week ago for a birthday treat .My son says .my best wishes for TL : - ) Nawal K Joshi ! Since when losers ?Effing place My shorts is more expensive than their pants .Dress code So finally I ws here .etc ......!!! ! Oh After a much publicized media hype around this restaurant , I decided to give them a try for a weekday dinner .Hyderabad blues is located on the 5th floor of Reliance Classic Building in Road # 1.The have a small take away counter in the ground floor as well .What is there to say ?It ' s a dhaba .You don ' t go for the service or the ambience .Had dinner here .The TOWNHOUSE .but elsewhere i have some doubts ..i appreciate that in Mumbai it must be a " big thing " of sorts Had been to yauatcha on a Sunday for lunch with family ..! ..See pic attached .how huge ?why not full ratings ?but acceptable .Frankly I ' ve never tried anything else .but that was to be expected .As i was roaming at DLF Place i found out this cafe which i have heard a lot about ..was there today .but that's about it .I ' ll explain anyway - firstly , the food ( obviously ) that was the first time I went there I am a die hard Chocoholic ( dark chocolate , no less ) ( i prefer the indiranagar outlet much more than their lavelle road sibling.) after our no.But they will lose in the long run .! coming to the food .!! My friends took me to the place .!!! We were not expecting seating immediately ..!! It is located on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay ( now renamed to The Lindsay ) .! ...! ?We went for dinner on Saturday ...! :( these are the perfect ingredients to wind up an ideal weekend .!My friends n I were very hungry and happened to visit this place on a Saturday afternoon .So you can understand the feeling It was up to the expectations .I visited Delhi last year as my cousin works there ..Hoping the ambiance and taste of the food to be excellent .We reached there early so were out early as well ..: ) !! The answer ' s no Read the reviews and decided to dine out yesterday .Waiting was here last month with couple of my friends .Well , in so many waiting by others restro.!Here we found only 5 mins of wait..??.The pizzas there ! My guess is that have been changed recently .: ) i visited this place on my friends recommendation : ) : P no idea what it was doing there p ! Entry is lonely and you can ' t make out if there is a lounge inside , all you can see is a big ' coming soon ' board outside the mall .The good thing is that they are having introductory offer i.e.! : I went to this place on a Sunday night ..I went there on tuesday night around 7 : 30 .Here on zomato it says that happy hours on tuesday are till 8 pm .But we were told that they are only till 7.So to sum it all up ....Remember to oblige .This is my 2am place .This is my 2am place .....being Jain dint get any thing new to try ..........! .The recently deceased Ping Pong always operated in Yauatcha ' s shadow .they should change name from Sultans of spice to sultans of food " : ) When I took the first bite I could get the taste was different .But after having few bites I was still doubtful .So I called the chef and he said that it ' s non vegetarian ..Wtf ! ..! As some correctly say , over a cup of coffee lots of things happen That ' s what happened with me .So this review is short and sweet ...Me and a friend of mine had been planning to try this place for a long time now and we eventually made it there .So plz try ..this is in just opposite to Jama Masjid and the nearest metro station is Dariyaganj from where you can walk down 0.5km to reach this place ..well any new restaurant around indiranagar is always a best thing .din get chance to visit the roof top .! .0 al though overbearing is appealing to such an extent that one feels it to be rather subtle .............Birthday the best day of my life ..! i love food but i had never visited karim's in my life .because i have started to write for Zomato i decided that it is time for me to change that .i believe it is imperative for every foodie to try karim's .i went with my extended family and there was a very sinister reason behind that .i wanted to try a lot of dishes and also when you travel and go to places with your family you do not have to pay ..! Both black and green i can define this place with one word .but i am definitely trying them on my next visit .!This concludes my review for Jamjar and yes If this review gets to Jamjar , gimme a near messy beef burger next time when im in , Ill ask for it .hopefully soon .# placesofmumbai Pleasant , isn ' t it ?( : Well this one is nothing like it .Visited the place for a friend ' s birthday bash .Lots of people have written detailed reviews about this place .So am giving a quick short review : 1...We had dinner at this charmingly difficult place to find .went there yesterday ...we were a group of 6 people .The first time was new year ' s eve , and the second on a Karaoke night ( Wednesdays ) .It is not on their menu for good reasons .How come , still a three ?As usual tradiion of Katani remain same .Its just i felt about may be that was for the same day i visited .even though you can find the similar taste here too , but something makes a difference .We chose to go to Lodi on a quiet breezy day of August .It had been a super long time since only me and my husband went out for a meal alone , so it was date night .Non intrusive yet very very alert ..Went yesterday to try the restaurant...so we decided not to sit here but in there other section ...But thought let it go .! : ) This was one of the first few restaurants that I visited when i first came to Delhi .why do you go to a restaurant ?simply to have good food ?if you are the second type then you are in the wrong place .it would hard to pin point a specific set of dishes .but everyone has always been telling me that one at jama maszid is the best ( no comparison ) .though he would always go their with his friends .Where do i start...trying going on an empty stomach so that you can taste everything tht is being served there .Only positive things to say finally decided to give it a try .Even in peak times ! Location : Jaipur Marriott Hotel .I don ' t know if they still serve it or not .If you are reading this review , chances are that you belong to the educated , moderately affluent , internet junkie category who is used to dining every now and then .So brace yourself ..and mostly for right reasons .however .! as mentioned i asked for a table on the terrace and as trivial as it may sound , truffles always come to my mind.waited for a very long time for this day .and on September 13 , it happened .dunkin Donuts , was finally in town ...i informed them too before ..onto the food  i wont describe the food will just add them Being a veggie , I really can ' t comment on much of the menu ...The only drawback being that it gets difficult to get a table if you are with a group of stags ! I have been to naivedyam and sagar ratna before .After months of hearing about Cyber hub - I finally made it there .!! ...I am not a very big fan of Indian food when I am dining out ....?this place after i had read the reviews was stuck into my wish list board and today i take it off there and put it into my been there list .peace.i at first being unknown to Zoo road had a little problem locating it ; Google maps took me there and when i saw this place i could only think how cute it was ...!! .I had gone to the flying elephant a few days back A big big ??to the attendants .As i went to phoenix today to visit Hewlett Packard in search for a laptop , i ended up starving and wandering the food court of Phoenix .I take a tour of all the stuff that has been collected over the years .! Sarvana bhawan is located just opposite to mybar in cp in p block .They gave us a table on the second floor .First , Its hard to find a Parsi restaurant in NCR , Second , good food along with it is occasional .I never been to Mumbai before where I assume I will find such restaurants in common .So , I am reviewing Parsi food as a virgin .! Ordered in these guys when we were having a party at a friends place at Panchsheel enclave .It was a drinking party so food wasn ' t the main focus .!!! .! Went at 12 midnight .! xd My tip - 1.2.I hope these guys keep the quality levels up and do not get complacent : - ) I ' ve visited once here .Food review following up .?Ya kam ho gayi ??Thank u At least during the day time .being a foodie had to try it .the palette cleansers are good .Since we went there for the first time , I requested the attendant to surprise us with three of their best dishes ..n man .!! Bliss ! hi all , i really dont know what to say about this place.first being goin to this place .! Our first stop for the Food Connect organized by Zomato and DLF Cyber Hub .I was pretty excited when I saw SBOW as one of the restaurants for foodie meet up .Meeting the fellow foodies on Zomato , whom I only know by name was pretty exciting .We were greeted the very bubbly team of Zomato .The other reviewers from Zomato kept on joining and the conversations started .they told us very interesting story about how they recreated it from the original one .They told us that the dish is from Goa and had Portuguese influence .Happy Eating Fellas 8 / 102 .Especially when a Mumbaiite like me has come from the Jimmy Boys and Iranian cafes of the city .not a good combination .ps - Beware of the electric " drink :) though i didn't go to Mumbai one .going to delhi during Diwali .! d The name is very close to the Parasi culture .Plus they ' re Harley buffs ! After a long time I happen to catch up with my friends and wanted to do Hukka .Odeon in CP .I along with my frnz thot of visiting the place so called social offline .Excuse me Why did you call us inside then ??Chalo nevertheless , we got the table , sat and decided quickly wat all to order .Can ' t comment anything about it ' s non veg portion as I am a veggie .#VALUE!The HM & amp ; Salad Bar and the Ground Floor HM are two entirely Different Places , Both in terms of ambiance and price .Believe you me .So , visit Hot Millions 2 , 1 and Salad Bar .

In punjabbi ......
I went to this place only coz I cudnt get tables in barbeque nation .
Visited the place the day before yesterday and could not stop myself writing my feelings post the same .
but now i m bored of it .
So I won ' t be able to judge better .
This is my first chingri biryani .
i went to this place on the first day of new year 2014 .
umm coming to the food ...
but as i am not much of a Pizza - lover , i neither got the impetus nor the oppurtunity to visit it again to actually judge whether they were able to keep up the initial quality when they had newly opened .
but as luck would have it , one of my friends decided to give us a birthday treat in this very place & amp ; here i was again .
now coming to the food ........
.
Me and my friend went for lunch at there Beltola outlet .
just one word 4 it ...
.
About the crowd or gentry i cant say much coz when i went to this place it was almost empty .
No review .
what to say .....
i heard about this restaurant ..
thought of try it out so me & amp ; my hubby went for lunch today ...
I recently visited this place with my husband .
though ....
!
now let me talk about my first visit to this restaurant .
We had asked whether reservations can be made a couple of days before we visited the place .
We then asked him to call his senior .
!!
.in fact I thought a tad bit more so 
______________Updates : i went back again for a bite .
The point is that the chef prepares everything with best efforts .
hence i made it a point to update and review 
!
but !
i went to this restaurant with a couple of friends .
as my first time in this restaurant and as i'm kind of allergic to prawns , i was confused about what to order .
in brief !
Period .
Who does that ?
That ' s some relief !
.
Been here recently in April 2014 .
It seems there is no club rules and everyone is allowed .
.!!
..
We did planned that we are going to checkout the place so we wont be spending much .
I can ' t forget the day it was a chili evening when i went there with a friend of mine just to check out a new place .
Didn ' t have the food .
but availability is a question mark !
though i stay out of it !
Apart from this , they have these small contests like drink 6 shot glasses of beer with a straw in 20 seconds and get a beer for free .
!
i would sum up all what i had to write with a single thing .
dis place is just ..
..
Currently it has the alcohol license for weekends and very soon they will acquire it for weekdays as well .
one thing to note , there is barely any cellphone reception inside so beware .
how i managed to rach Digboi after eating here is still a marvel to me
...We wish to njoy a pre planned table seating experience next time ; ) All the best .
.
.for 4 days .
.wish you could send to us in Mumbai.
.
?
?
this place is close to the Bikaner house and is in a hard to miss pandara road market dotted with various restaurants .
nyc gathering ...
That sums up my experience in Tao .
?
.

Me and my Frnd were the only customers last night for dinner .
People at first even I was like " whats the point of having bengali food outside home ?
i'm eating here as i write ..
! 
gotta go 
i was told that there was no queue and waiting time since it was a Tuesday when a lot of people in northern India abstain from non veg food .
too bad they have been shutting early lately 
! 
starting with the ambience ..
and bar ( if possible ) not necessary ...
You won ' t feel like you ' re in Pune .
opens for people around 11 or so and the biryani is brought from their kitchen in a huge drum and the ghee is mixed in front of the crowd .
their are other items too 
!! 
! 
We were at Jaipur on a short visit , 11 to 14.07 .

nothing out of the box , with two accolades from - zomato & amp ; toi gleaming onto the wall ..
food 
Unsure why this place is trending in the top list .
al 
olwayswhenevr i hit bkp there is one thing olways peeking out of mah mind ..
its too less over here ..
but for some reason or the other could not make it .
at last i made it l here last week .
Going out with friends and no new place to go .
.
finally we got a place inside the restaurant ...
try to let it not piss you off .
i had already heard of this place from my friends during my college days .
but ultimately gathered some courage and entered the place .
Went to the restaurant on a sunday afternoon .
was in Kalyani for a few days and heard a lot about this place .
but you gotta stand in a line for a Biriyani take away .
.
.
Now what to say about Batman .
Batman has solution for all your problems .
al 
though i didn't feel that great as it's shown in pics .
have been to Hyatt in Bombay 
:) .
I don ' t know where is the DEN for this BATMAN but sure it delivered food .
Coming to the food .
The funniest part is you can ask the delivery guy , " Are you BATMAN ?
HAHA 
yet to taste other dish of it .
i hope , others will be good too .
somehow i have been to this place just twice , inspite of its proximity to my place .
probably that's one criterion that scores decent points .
comprehensive review regarding dining experience will be put up by the end of the day  
this review will be a consolidated one of my all visits .
, .
?
local of 7 years now ..
So my best bet would be to order at home 
alright , let me just say that people often form their opinions based on what they hear about a place and not by the actual food .
my opinion , let me assure you , is free from from all such influences .
is it true ?
it had a mix of pretty much everything around the world .
at this point , i was quite interested to what would be put out in the plates .
but of course at this time , i still hadn't tasted their food so i couldn't have known if it was worth the wait .
you go at 0000 hrs and you can still get an entry to have food in there .
their worst part 
! 
a special note for the owners ..
Rest of the factors are ok .
We went for a reunion and one of had a fast that day , she was supposed to eat just fried potatoes with no salt .
We were all amazed and it did not end there .

this place is actually not in Kolkata 
but no one even looks at the menu .
just on your micro - oven for 5mins ...
its Just Not About Health , Wealth Or Driving a Benz And Entering Grand Or Park .
its Something Which Makes Your Inner Heart Skip a Hundred Times .

These pop ups are synonymous with the Batman series which used to come on TV .
partying with friends ) , the house party will go on further for at least a couple of hours , the initial plates of biryani have been gobbled up in a jiffy and suddenly hunger strikes 
.
Who should you call ?
Batman Delivers .
And apart from food , they have other stuff also which they can deliver .
Although , I wish they had all the popular brands of cigarettes otherwise here it would have been a 5 star rating .
Trust me , the Dark Knight has risen .
mamu ..
a name we fondly gave to the guy at the dairy close to xavier's ...
keeping in mind the modest beginning they made .
keeping up to the legacy and loyalty they have built up working in this field and literally starting from the scratch .
can't blame the management for this ..
! 
: ) 
what more can you ask for ?
.
.
Nothing to complain about .
.
! 
wen i first heard d name i laughed my gutts out ..
.
..
..
Speciality in that .
.
Confuses at the first go .
.
one more from the Pandara road diary , and this one is also worth tasting .
! 
After a couple of times i just decided to go hungry .
.thumbs up for the founders..keep it up .
.
; ) 
but i hadn't heard about this place until the Friendships Day this year .
but since i am not an orange person i went ahead for this one .
so you may give it a try .
.
.
at all 
Go for it .
Yesterday we three people went to have some gupshup and experience the food here .
! 
the best thing here is don't check the menu at all ...
We were a bunch of 10 friends out to have dinner , reservations were made before hand .
Replay as seen and read about in the reviews here , was a little off as compared to it .
! 
.
! 
if you are a true lover of biryani ...
?
.
I always passed frm this place .
..Bt never visited it .
Why they chose to hire him is beyond me .
Only giving the 1.5 because I was shocked that they actually showed up .
after the saavan fast got over i was eagerly waiting to have non veg .
so planned to go to Gulati .
firstly i want to point out that not every buffet style restaurant serve authentic food as it is prepared in large quantity for a large crowd .
reached just before happy hours end We ordered some dears but they limit us to order only less because happy hour going to end .
it didn ' t make sense to us .
I went to celebrate my birthday with my friends .
It was Saturday evening and we.
it didn ' t make sense to us .
and this is the reasom y i choose to give it a 4 and not 4.5 or 5 .
comming down to the most important thing , food .
.
i had referred to the rating Zomato before going .
Class of food .
how cool is that ...
air Cafe Lounge ..
air Cafe Lounge ..
! 
visited the place today after a long gap .
I basically don ' t smoke and don ' t drink .
.
We almost spent 5 hours .
they do allow people to have small celebrations like Birthday dinners which can be a little un settling at times as the people celebrating hardly consider about others having dinner there .
the wall full of framed certificates display their excellence over the years .
: D 
Want to try a new place ?
! 
its hard to be in dis industry wid old name ...
.
Took my team out to Air Cafe Lounge .
Not sure if it qualifies as true Burmese but it felt like it was Indo / Chinese / Thai inspired .
We went strictly by the waiter ' s recommendations .
..
! 
was very hungry so couldn't wait to click pictures .
sorry 
p 
Lets start with getting a table .
When i called them they wre booked for a friday nite but yet i thought of giving it a try .
you cannot eat much Biriyani in Arsalan bcoz of that dalda ..
Friends , post - dinner hunger thus shiv Sagar .
! 
you are looking for joey's ..
...
?
About 20 of us had dinner here 
: ) 
?
Restaurant in town...
i can't understand why people are rating it even 2 .
! 
..hav a feel good feelin inside u as well .
place 
located in Andheri just ahead of juhu circle .
making it perfect for students .
food 
.
only cons 
! 
!!! 
! 
maybe new setup get to suit ppl slowly ..
it's one of those places ..
nothing out of the place ...
its in cp ..
hit it on any lazy saturday or sunday for Lunch 
i must have passed by this place n number of times during the past 6 years , finally , yesterday i got a chance to visit this place with my Bosses and my client for an informal get together .
.
limited 
which is what speaks volumes about the ideology of the restaurant 
.
But v got quickly as v were only two .
in Delhi it is not easy to find the authentic indian restaurant any more .
today the Indian food has been modernized to such an extent that it can actually be called fusion food .
if one has a craving for a modernized take on the Indian cuisine then there is no shortage of restaurants .
butter and was just falling apart .
caution 
! 
Location : Main Tonk Road near the Rambagh Circle .
It was not what we had in mind .
Is Batman so Garib in India .
Man man man 
! 
Getting up to the restaurant is a task though .
Somehow it slept out of my mind and I called them at two in afternoon for table booking .
They were closed for any bookings but they asked us to reach by 7.30 so that we will be getting table .
Me and my brother reached and for our surprize there were only few table left to be filled .
first of all , i am delighted ( and also very much surprised ) to see 'Dada Boudi ' in Zomato 
now when it's here , i can't refrain myself from reviewing it .
here what only matters is the food.
last week we went there after four long years and when we came out we could only say 
HIGH 
.
! 
! 
!U Can visit if a big Foodie 
; ) 
Walked in on a Friday night to find the place bustling with people all ready to get their drink on .
..got really packed post 1...few starlets nd strugglers hanging around on d edge of d dancefloor...bachelorette parties .
.
bdays...nd kitty party aunties out dancing was the general type of crowd that night .
..Thanks Sudeep fr the tour nd the absolutely amazing pizza.
but also locals , perhaps on a 50 - 50 proportion .
cp has been really surprising me with the sizes of the restaurants .
i 
but 
however so far i have discovered that it is the contrary .
I booked a table for dinner and specified them that we are 10 adults and 2 children .
The person sitting at the end of the table had to pass his glass to the waiter serving water .
This review is for Pirates of Grill , Rajouri Garden .
Their is something special about the whole pandara road market and nearby khan market .
That it is located in the posh area of Delhi only adds to the whole experience .
just one tip 
Because of great weather only the outside area was operational .
The place started filling at 10 : 30 as the entry is less before 11pm .
I had initially planned to eat pao bhaji , but she explained that they are a franchise soon becoming a self owned place , named nini ' s kitchen .
The franchise had asked them to make pre - cooked pao bhaji and they rebelled and now they could work on their own terms .
And I wonder what they would do with the graffiti that has juice lounge written all over it .
though .
i have been here once .
following are my rating 
I have been a regular customer of this place since 2001 .
I might be unlucky to get these .
..

:) love it

Though I am writing this review a bit late ...
But as it is said it is better late than never..
I hosted a party for 30 pax .
I asked them the reason for it they said that they have a bar which is near the dining area ( got d hint dat this place is basically for drinking and not for food ) .Requested them to allow us with the child as it was too early and would leave the place in a hour .
Ka bhaiyya who was hired a few days back .
..I miss that place so much .
But unfortunately it ' s place has been taken by GARBAGE ' 69 ( no pun intended ) Management u can argue on dis m game .
..cauz u ' ll r just fooling ppl .
Gulati...
!!! 
! 
How do i know ?
.
It came it my name written on it 
.
it was a Sunday eve ..
i had been their with my family ..
! 
The poor things who are raving about these dishes havent had the chance to taste the authentic stuff.
i happened to grab a Groupon voucher as i was on a group meet up .
That ' s what we did .
I ' m not even kidding .
This place was on my bucket list since a very long time .
Finally got to have a taste of this place .
reminds you of the time when you were a kid 
so if you are willing to experiment try it out with an open mind .
although Bangalore doesn't have much of sky line .
for some reason i was in the mood to splurge on food that day .
first hoping that i can use my chopsticks right and then to see if i like this rubbery Cuttle fish ....
go well covered , woolens if you can .
cause its freezing up there .
you are sure to catch a chill2 ..
haven't been here in a while .
The variety of breads and spreads on offer is really .
Recommended ?
.
: ) 
...Dey serve 
! 
went there for lunch.
then came the test .
What more ?
Choice of drinks ?
my bday bash ..
.
.
No kidding .
The friend who offered to share this with you will say " oh that sounds like it ' ll be too heavy " .
Trust me .
You need to try this .
You ' re killing me .
although it is comparitively smaller than its other counterparts , when it comes to pizzas ...
The place started to be fill in at around 11.00pm .
We ordered our drinks and got chatting with the gentleman making our cocktails ( who we later realised was the owner ) .
We just happened to go there one Saturday evening .
Anyways let ' s get to the point .
Food .
Blimey 
! 
?
: ) 
?
but this time we put up a fight .
Lets rock @ Gangsta , Bandra near natioanl college 
?...
Came here for lunch today .
Plus it was drizzling to add to the sheer beauty of the place .
But if you truly want the place ' s true taste , try it having it outside .
The place also has one more zone in the back of the enclave .
And it surely is .
.
On a fine afternoon , me and colleagues were off with hectic schedule and thought to cool off with some good food : - ) Searched nearby places on Zomato and selected Pirates of Grill to be the place .
...

Pal dhaba

Dil kush hota hai jab kuch dil ko touch kar jata hai

Many a times I passed this place and couldn ' t go due to reasons .
This time I went to drop my sister and squeezed some time to get a parcel .

I went with high hope to this place .
I had expected the appetizer to be fried with oil in it .
We are supposed to visit another restaurant but came here as there was heavy public in that restaurant .
1.
..Now the main matter the food .
Bombay brasserie : * 
go empty stomach .
!!! 
.
went there for lunch ...
We went to this place with high expectations .
But owing to the fact that Bangalore does not have a skyline , the height is not utilised at all .
A place at this height in Mumbai would have been much better .
Go here 
This is probably the first hookah parlours ' in guwahati .
If u want to hv good punjabi food around cp .

Lodi is ( obviously ) located on the lodi road , next to the Islamic Center near IHC .
Ask them for suggestions 
Thankfully the weather was on our side as well 
We decided to sit inside .
They noticed 
They opened , we got a table for 3.
People tend to eat while drinking .
So be proficient in ordering .
Or else you will be carrying food back home 
Had been here on August 31st with my love for celebrating our 3rd anniversary .
Ambience .
Food .
Thanks for that 
Went there on 5 September 2014 to celebrate the Teachers day .
OK , I ' ll be honest ; I don ' t really remember what we ordered here .
Zippr code : YAXE8298

Haha

improve that and the outlet can be really good .
god knows 
we made ourselves sit and placed our order .

ding ding the two competitors in the ring .....
i just entered this place randomly 
i couldn't try much of food that day .
thought it would in late evening .
may be it was more cz of my company , 
.....
.
Thursday a good day to go .
i had been wanting to go this place since a long time and i finally suggested this place to my cousins while we were deciding to go somewhere to dine .
next visit is with husband .
already planned .
.
however , here it is 
trust me , it's just The village .

: D 
The only word that can define it 
.
FANTASTIC Sunday afternoon .
.....
! 
You have breeze around .
What ?
Are you kidding me ?
It ' s just a gimmick to create hype .
This is the only annoying part about this place .
The best part came at the last .
.
May it be soccer , cricket , hockey .
went there a week ago for a birthday treat .
My son says .
my best wishes for TL

Since when losers ?
Effing place 
My shorts is more expensive than their pants .
Dress code 
So finally I ws here .
etc .
..
...!!!

Oh 
After a much publicized media hype around this restaurant , I decided to give them a try for a weekday dinner .
Hyderabad blues is located on the 5th floor of Reliance Classic Building in Road # 1.
The have a small take away counter in the ground floor as well .
What is there to say ?
It ' s a dhaba .
You don ' t go for the service or the ambience .
Had dinner here .
The TOWNHOUSE .
but elsewhere i have some doubts ..
i appreciate that in Mumbai it must be a " big thing " of sorts 
Had been to yauatcha on a Sunday for lunch with family .
.
! 
..
See pic attached .
how huge ?
why not full ratings ?
but acceptable .
Frankly I ' ve never tried anything else .
but that was to be expected .
As i was roaming at DLF Place i found out this cafe which i have heard a lot about .
.
was there today .
but that's about it .
I ' ll explain anyway - firstly , the food ( obviously ) 
that was the first time I went there 
I am a die hard Chocoholic ( dark chocolate , no less ) 
( i prefer the indiranagar outlet much more than their lavelle road sibling.) 
after our no.
But they will lose in the long run .
! 
coming to the food .
!! 
My friends took me to the place .
!!! 
We were not expecting seating immediately .
.
!! 
It is located on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay ( now renamed to The Lindsay 
) .
! 
..
.
! 
?
We went for dinner on Saturday .
..
! 
:( 
these are the perfect ingredients to wind up an ideal weekend .
!My friends n I were very hungry and happened to visit this place on a Saturday afternoon .
So you can understand the feeling 
It was up to the expectations .
I visited Delhi last year as my cousin works there .
.
Hoping the ambiance and taste of the food to be excellent .
We reached there early so were out early as well .
.
: ) 
!! 
The answer ' s no 
Read the reviews and decided to dine out yesterday .
Waiting 
was here last month with couple of my friends .
Well , in so many waiting by others restro.
!Here we found only 5 mins of wait..?
?
.
The pizzas there 
! 
My guess is that have been changed recently .
: ) 
i visited this place on my friends recommendation 
: ) 
: P 
no idea what it was doing there 
p 
! 
Entry is lonely and you can ' t make out if there is a lounge inside , all you can see is a big ' coming soon ' board outside the mall .
The good thing is that they are having introductory offer i.e.
! 
: 
I went to this place on a Sunday night .
.
I went there on tuesday night around 7 : 30 .
Here on zomato it says that happy hours on tuesday are till 8 pm .
But we were told that they are only till 7.
So to sum it all up .
.
..
Remember to oblige 
.
This is my 2am place .
This is my 2am place .
....being Jain dint get any thing new to try .
.....
..
.
.
! 
.
The recently deceased Ping Pong always operated in Yauatcha ' s shadow .
they should change name from Sultans of spice to 
sultans of food " : ) 
When I took the first bite I could get the taste was different .
But after having few bites I was still doubtful .
So I called the chef and he said that it ' s non vegetarian .
.
Wtf 
! 
..
! 
As some correctly say , over a cup of coffee lots of things happen 
That ' s what happened with me .
So this review is short and sweet .
.
.
Me and a friend of mine had been planning to try this place for a long time now and we eventually made it there .
So plz try .
.
this is in just opposite to Jama Masjid and the nearest metro station is Dariyaganj from where you can walk down 0.5km to reach this place ..
well any new restaurant around indiranagar is always a best thing .
din get chance to visit the roof top .

Birthday the best day of my life .
.
! 
i love food 
but i had never visited karim's in my life .
because i have started to write for Zomato i decided that it is time for me to change that .
i believe it is imperative for every foodie to try karim's .
i went with my extended family and there was a very sinister reason behind that .
i wanted to try a lot of dishes and also when you travel and go to places with your family you do not have to pay .
.
! 
Both black and green 
i can define this place with one word .
but i am definitely trying them on my next visit .
!This concludes my review for Jamjar and yes If this review gets to Jamjar , gimme a near messy beef burger next time when im in , Ill ask for it .
hopefully soon .
# placesofmumbai 
Pleasant , isn ' t it ?
( : Well this one is nothing like it .
Visited the place for a friend ' s birthday bash .
Lots of people have written detailed reviews about this place .
So am giving a quick short review : 1.
..
We had dinner at this charmingly difficult place to find .
went there yesterday ...
we were a group of 6 people .
The first time was new year ' s eve , and the second on a Karaoke night ( Wednesdays ) .
It is not on their menu for good reasons .
How come , still a three ?
As usual tradiion of Katani remain same .
Its just i felt about may be that was for the same day i visited .
even though you can find the similar taste here too , but something makes a difference .
We chose to go to Lodi on a quiet breezy day of August .
It had been a super long time since only me and my husband went out for a meal alone , so it was date night .
Non intrusive yet very very alert .
.Went yesterday to try the restaurant..
.so we decided not to sit here but in there other section .
..
But thought let it go .
! 
: ) 
This was one of the first few restaurants that I visited when i first came to Delhi .
why do you go to a restaurant ?
simply to have good food ?
if you are the second type then you are in the wrong place .
it would hard to pin point a specific set of dishes .
but everyone has always been telling me that one at jama maszid is the best ( no comparison ) .
though he would always go their with his friends .
Where do i start...trying going on an empty stomach so that you can taste everything tht is being served there .
Only positive things to say 
finally decided to give it a try .
Even in peak times 
! 
Location : Jaipur Marriott Hotel .
I don ' t know if they still serve it or not .
If you are reading this review , chances are that you belong to the educated , moderately affluent , internet junkie category who is used to dining every now and then .
So brace yourself .
.
and mostly for right reasons .
however .
! 
as mentioned i asked for a table on the terrace 
and as trivial as it may sound 
, truffles always come to my mind.
waited for a very long time for this day .
and on September 13 , it happened .
dunkin Donuts , was finally in town .
..i informed them too before .
.
onto the food  
i wont describe the food will just add them 
Being a veggie , I really can ' t comment on much of the menu .
..
The only drawback being that it gets difficult to get a table if you are with a group of stags 
! 
I have been to naivedyam and sagar ratna before .
After months of hearing about Cyber hub - I finally made it there .
!! 
...
I am not a very big fan of Indian food when I am dining out .
..
.
?
this place after i had read the reviews was stuck into my wish list board and today i take it off there and put it into my been there list .
peace.
i at first being unknown to Zoo road had a little problem locating it ; Google maps took me there and when i saw this place i could only think how cute it was .
.
.!! 
.
I had gone to the flying elephant a few days back 
A big big ?
?
to the attendants .
As i went to phoenix today to visit Hewlett Packard in search for a laptop , i ended up starving and wandering the food court of Phoenix .
I take a tour of all the stuff that has been collected over the years .
! 
Sarvana bhawan is located just opposite to mybar in cp in p block .
They gave us a table on the second floor .
First , Its hard to find a Parsi restaurant in NCR , Second , good food along with it is occasional .
I never been to Mumbai before where I assume I will find such restaurants in common .
So , I am reviewing Parsi food as a virgin .
! 
Ordered in these guys when we were having a party at a friends place at Panchsheel enclave .
It was a drinking party so food wasn ' t the main focus .
!!! 
.
! 
Went at 12 midnight .
! 
xd 
My tip - 1.
2.
I hope these guys keep the quality levels up and do not get complacent : - ) 
I ' ve visited once here .
Food review following up .
?
Ya kam ho gayi ?
?
Thank u 
At least during the day time .
being a foodie had to try it .
the palette cleansers are good .
Since we went there for the first time , I requested the attendant to surprise us with three of their best dishes .
.
n man .
!! 
Bliss

hi all , i really dont know what to say about this place.
first being goin to this place .
! 
Our first stop for the Food Connect organized by Zomato and DLF Cyber Hub .
I was pretty excited when I saw SBOW as one of the restaurants for foodie meet up .
Meeting the fellow foodies on Zomato , whom I only know by name was pretty exciting .
We were greeted the very bubbly team of Zomato .
The other reviewers from Zomato kept on joining and the conversations started .
they told us very interesting story about how they recreated it from the original one .
They told us that the dish is from Goa and had Portuguese influence .
Happy Eating Fellas 
8 / 102 .
Especially when a Mumbaiite like me has come from the Jimmy Boys and Iranian cafes of the city .
not a good combination .
ps - Beware of the 
electric " drink

though i didn't go to Mumbai one .
going to delhi during Diwali .

The name is very close to the Parasi culture .
Plus they ' re Harley buffs 
! 
After a long time I happen to catch up with my friends and wanted to do Hukka .
Odeon in CP .
I along with my frnz thot of visiting the place so called social offline .
Excuse me 
Why did you call us inside then ?
?
Chalo nevertheless , we got the table , sat and decided quickly wat all to order .
Can ' t comment anything about it ' s non veg portion as I am a veggie .
#VALUE!
The HM & amp ; Salad Bar and the Ground Floor HM are two entirely Different Places , Both in terms of ambiance and price .
Believe you me .
