Talk about Food on Wheels.
This is what happened in my case .
Take a risk if u want , every one has a different taste pallete , mine is extremely hard to impress bcuz im always looking for strange and bizarre tastes .
Yes !
so I hope the second chance will be enough to meet my expectations .
you have guessed it right .
Thats what we felt was amiss in an otherwise perfect setting .
A much hyped restaurant in the modern cyber hub which out of curiosity I went for lunch .
I visited there with my wife i heard a lot about this place but never visit.
Yes !
For a foodie like me , This has filled me up and charged me to try another destinations in Delhi .
You wont regret.
: D
If you are hungry and wanna have the best chicken ever .

I visited this place yesterday afternoon .
There are few burger places in India and any new restaurants are most welcome .
I don ' t think so .
..no seriously !
!!!
I m not exaggerating ....
If u r looking for good food mughal style ...
PERI PERI Chicken still haunts me in my dreams .
Unfortunately , the friend who introduced me to this place has turned vegetarian and so , I havent had the opportunity to go back .
..
..one thing which is very imporatant , if u love the food there .
.. then don ' t fill your stomach just by it .
.
.
I have been here twice.. And always had lunch buffet .
Timeless it is .
........we can choose some other option in this price - - - - - 29 Sep , 2013 - - - - - good food .
I visited this place with my colleagues .
A suggestion though , go on an empty stomach to do justice to the food and the money you pay .
They have a set menu for dinner veg and non veg .
I opted for Veggie meal .
After kabab ' s in main course they provide cooked vegetables , Dals and your choice of breads to be followed by Biryani .
But make sure to have enough ability to eat the entire meal .
Great !
Soo going there too often dosent make sense !
However came to know that it has stopped serving buffets ever since the prefix Gulati has attached to its name .
In Starter we ordered Makai Seekh and Burrah Akbari ( Kebab ) & amp ; Neza kebab .
..no seriously !
!!!
I m not exaggerating ....
If u r looking for good food mughal style ...
Its just a sort of take away joint ..
I had to shell Rs.
.... must have !
Hi .
am rated it 4.

Moist and flavorful .
.but speaking of food .
Thanks team
!!!!
Carried its name in well productive manner .
We came on a Saturday night without a reservation and there was only seating available at the bar , which was okay with us .
Didn ' t order any drinks , we went straight for the food .
Anyway , onto the important stuff : food .
We decided on ordering 3 appetizers so we could sample more food .
I really wanted to like this place .
I read the great reviews and was enthused .
You read it below in a couple reviews and it ' s true .
...
After 4 weekends , I jus happened 2 get a chance to get a seat in this joint on a Sunday afternoon !
!!
Coming to food .
Along with it , a fresh mint mocktail .
Will not write apart from highlighting specific instances.1.
We had 1 / 4 the chicken in mild peri peri sauce and the moroccan burger with fillet .
Had gone to cyber hub , gurgaon on 14 dec for the TOI gliterarti festival .
The place reminded me of the The Walk JBR , Dubai .
!
!
.
My order was a simple quarter grilled chicken , medium spicy with sides of corn and 3 bean salad .
I was not ready for over eating today but any other day , I would have gone for other sauces and options on the menu .
Leaving that for next time !
Waiting for their liquor licence to get approved .
When I got to know that Dhaba has stepped out of it ' s hotel vicinity I was the one who was for sure one of the happiest person .
Recenty , I visited the outlet at DLF Place , Saket .
Though that part of the outlet is really .
Dhaba by Claridges is a typical Indian Restaurant opened by Claridges .
Ambience : *

Ajay
After looking couple of venues for my birthday get together .

Drink and dine... , cheers !
!!!!!!
: )
At least thats what I did .
I had gone to this place 3 - 4 times .
1.
3.
2.
!
The good part.
.
Others limited but good .
Don ' t have liquor license as of now but said they l get one soon .
.
Went here to enjoy a evening .
..
I ask for the manager .
After reading a review in Timeout Delhi I was excited to check out Townhall with friends on a Sunday night for dinner .
He quickly disappeared .
!
I recommend checking out there upcoming events @ https : / / www.facebook.com / fursatse .
To top it all .
Since I belong from Kolkata , I naturally have a weakness for Bijoli Grill .
But the important thing is whether they are doing justice to the true taste of Bengal ?
?
Daturas night me and my wife went out for a dinner to bukhara .
Who hasn ' t heard of this place , or its famous dal bukhara .
You just need to call them a day in advance and ask them to prepare it .
!
The was so baffle with the fact that why is it so popular for its Dal .
Don ' t waste time on reading reviews .
Who goes to Bukhara anymore ?
Its only for tourists after all .
!!
?
?
?
?
Thats the same league as the fat duck and the french laundry .
I have had food here more than a dozen times .
The menu was limited , which was actually better , the less the options , the less the confusion about what to eat .
You go to Bukhara and you know what you will be eating .
Would definitely be coming here a lot more .
Visited this place for the first time yesterday as a farewell dinner for a dear friend .
While we liked the interiors of Dum Pukht more , we ended up visiting Bukhara as we had heard a lot about it .
!
: D
Wasn ' t sure to add a review for this place as I hardly know anyone who hasn ' t been here and Iv been here countless timesThe Bukhara daal still has the same taste over 20 + years .
One item that people might miss is the firni ( dessert ) it ' s a must have especially in the summers it ' s refreshing .
Went there for Lunch on Sunday 13th April 2014 .

So I went to explore .
From having the Monkey touch .
In short , a must visit !
Have fun while you can : )
We heart you now .
We visited Side Wok recently for a team lunch on recommendation from a colleague .
Khan Market is a Hub of places serving Chines food and all depends on what kind of chines food you like .
From so Called Authentic chines to Punjabi Chines .
They also delivers within 5 kms or so , which is also almost within the promised time .
Alkauser owners have a history associated to them .
And my view on Alkauser ' s Al - Kakori ?
Both stands apart on their reputation .
I have had many gratifying meals from Al Kauser over the past few years but only once took a table outside to sit and eat ; which is only doable during one of the winter months .
GREAT !
!
!
Most people had second helpings .
!
!!
What ' s more .
.
.
.
even on weekdays..
Saket as i hear this name it just give me a scenario of southies or o can say a hub for south delhi people .
Hard Rock Cafe located in DLF mall which is one of the .
Finding way is bit difficult but when you see this from a distance .
We come here very often .
I Went there on a saturday night for dinner .
I visited Geoffrey ' s with a few friends recently .
Frankly , the place felt a little too formal for a visit with friends , mainly because of the crowd .
520 pp tax inclusive .
Not for a friendly lunch or dinner though .
I ' d say , if you had to take your office colleagues or your ' serious ' uncle along , I would recommend this place .
Again , its a matter of choice .
Also , no beverage is included in the buffet .
.
.
Glad to see it opened so close to my place .
I drop here straight here after my office and I always do fine some friends .
Lets get down to the business .
If you looking for experiment in ur appetide .
Finally had a chance to visit Nandos in Cyber City !
Nando ' s has been on our list for long now .
We went with my husband for a Sunday lunch and based on the reviews we were there by 12 : 30 as we both love to avoid crowd .
I will keep it short and sweet .
