Talk about Food on Wheels.
This is what happened in my case .
Take a risk if u want , every one has a different taste pallete , mine is extremely hard to impress bcuz im always looking for strange and bizarre tastes .
Yes !
so I hope the second chance will be enough to meet my expectations .
you have guessed it right .
Thats what we felt was amiss in an otherwise perfect setting .
A much hyped restaurant in the modern cyber hub which out of curiosity I went for lunch .
I visited there with my wife i heard a lot about this place but never visit.
Yes !
For a foodie like me , This has filled me up and charged me to try another destinations in Delhi .
You wont regret.
: D
If you are hungry and wanna have the best chicken ever .

I visited this place yesterday afternoon .
There are few burger places in India and any new restaurants are most welcome .
I don ' t think so .
..no seriously !
!!!
I m not exaggerating ....
If u r looking for good food mughal style ...
PERI PERI Chicken still haunts me in my dreams .
Unfortunately , the friend who introduced me to this place has turned vegetarian and so , I havent had the opportunity to go back .
..
..one thing which is very imporatant , if u love the food there .
.. then don ' t fill your stomach just by it .
.
.
I have been here twice.. And always had lunch buffet .
Timeless it is .
........we can choose some other option in this price - - - - - 29 Sep , 2013 - - - - - good food .
I visited this place with my colleagues .
A suggestion though , go on an empty stomach to do justice to the food and the money you pay .
They have a set menu for dinner veg and non veg .
I opted for Veggie meal .
After kabab ' s in main course they provide cooked vegetables , Dals and your choice of breads to be followed by Biryani .
But make sure to have enough ability to eat the entire meal .
Great !
Soo going there too often dosent make sense !
However came to know that it has stopped serving buffets ever since the prefix Gulati has attached to its name .
In Starter we ordered Makai Seekh and Burrah Akbari ( Kebab ) & amp ; Neza kebab .
..no seriously !
!!!
I m not exaggerating ....
If u r looking for good food mughal style ...
Its just a sort of take away joint ..
I had to shell Rs.
.... must have !
Hi .
am rated it 4.
5
Moist and flavorful .
.but speaking of food .
Thanks team
!!!!
Carried its name in well productive manner .
We came on a Saturday night without a reservation and there was only seating available at the bar , which was okay with us .
Didn ' t order any drinks , we went straight for the food .
Anyway , onto the important stuff : food .
We decided on ordering 3 appetizers so we could sample more food .
I really wanted to like this place .
I read the great reviews and was enthused .
You read it below in a couple reviews and it ' s true .
...
After 4 weekends , I jus happened 2 get a chance to get a seat in this joint on a Sunday afternoon !
!!
Coming to food .
Along with it , a fresh mint mocktail .
Will not write apart from highlighting specific instances.1.
We had 1 / 4 the chicken in mild peri peri sauce and the moroccan burger with fillet .
Had gone to cyber hub , gurgaon on 14 dec for the TOI gliterarti festival .
The place reminded me of the The Walk JBR , Dubai .
!
!
.
My order was a simple quarter grilled chicken , medium spicy with sides of corn and 3 bean salad .
I was not ready for over eating today but any other day , I would have gone for other sauces and options on the menu .
Leaving that for next time !
Waiting for their liquor licence to get approved .
When I got to know that Dhaba has stepped out of it ' s hotel vicinity I was the one who was for sure one of the happiest person .
Recenty , I visited the outlet at DLF Place , Saket .
Though that part of the outlet is really .
Dhaba by Claridges is a typical Indian Restaurant opened by Claridges .

After looking couple of venues for my birthday get together .
.
.
!!!
.. Do try !
Drink and dine... , cheers !
!!!!!!
: )
At least thats what I did .
I had gone to this place 3 - 4 times .
1.
3.
2.
!
The good part.
.
Others limited but good .
Don ' t have liquor license as of now but said they l get one soon .
.
Went here to enjoy a evening .
..
I ask for the manager .
After reading a review in Timeout Delhi I was excited to check out Townhall with friends on a Sunday night for dinner .
He quickly disappeared .
!
I recommend checking out there upcoming events @ https : / / www.facebook.com / fursatse .
To top it all .
Since I belong from Kolkata , I naturally have a weakness for Bijoli Grill .
But the important thing is whether they are doing justice to the true taste of Bengal ?
?
Daturas night me and my wife went out for a dinner to bukhara .
Who hasn ' t heard of this place , or its famous dal bukhara .
You just need to call them a day in advance and ask them to prepare it .
!
The was so baffle with the fact that why is it so popular for its Dal .
Don ' t waste time on reading reviews .
Who goes to Bukhara anymore ?
Its only for tourists after all .
!!
?
?
?
?
Thats the same league as the fat duck and the french laundry .
I have had food here more than a dozen times .
The menu was limited , which was actually better , the less the options , the less the confusion about what to eat .
You go to Bukhara and you know what you will be eating .
Would definitely be coming here a lot more .
Visited this place for the first time yesterday as a farewell dinner for a dear friend .
While we liked the interiors of Dum Pukht more , we ended up visiting Bukhara as we had heard a lot about it .
!
: D
Wasn ' t sure to add a review for this place as I hardly know anyone who hasn ' t been here and Iv been here countless timesThe Bukhara daal still has the same taste over 20 + years .
One item that people might miss is the firni ( dessert ) it ' s a must have especially in the summers it ' s refreshing .
Went there for Lunch on Sunday 13th April 2014 .
!!

So I went to explore .
From having the Monkey touch .
In short , a must visit !
Have fun while you can : )
We heart you now .
We visited Side Wok recently for a team lunch on recommendation from a colleague .
Khan Market is a Hub of places serving Chines food and all depends on what kind of chines food you like .
From so Called Authentic chines to Punjabi Chines .
They also delivers within 5 kms or so , which is also almost within the promised time .
Alkauser owners have a history associated to them .
And my view on Alkauser ' s Al - Kakori ?
Both stands apart on their reputation .
I have had many gratifying meals from Al Kauser over the past few years but only once took a table outside to sit and eat ; which is only doable during one of the winter months .
GREAT !
!
!
Most people had second helpings .
!
!!
What ' s more .
.
.
.
even on weekdays..
Saket as i hear this name it just give me a scenario of southies or o can say a hub for south delhi people .
Hard Rock Cafe located in DLF mall which is one of the .
Finding way is bit difficult but when you see this from a distance .
We come here very often .
I Went there on a saturday night for dinner .
I visited Geoffrey ' s with a few friends recently .
Frankly , the place felt a little too formal for a visit with friends , mainly because of the crowd .
520 pp tax inclusive .
Not for a friendly lunch or dinner though .
I ' d say , if you had to take your office colleagues or your ' serious ' uncle along , I would recommend this place .
Again , its a matter of choice .
Also , no beverage is included in the buffet .
.
.
Glad to see it opened so close to my place .
I drop here straight here after my office and I always do fine some friends .
Lets get down to the business .
If you looking for experiment in ur appetide .
Finally had a chance to visit Nandos in Cyber City !
Nando ' s has been on our list for long now .
We went with my husband for a Sunday lunch and based on the reviews we were there by 12 : 30 as we both love to avoid crowd .
I will keep it short and sweet .
Period .
Me and my Frnd were the only customers last night for dinner .
Visited the place for a friend ' s birthday bash .
Lots of people have written detailed reviews about this place .
So am giving a quick short review : 1.
.
I along with my frnz thot of visiting the place so called social offline .
Excuse me !
Why did you call us inside then ?
?
?
Chalo nevertheless , we got the table , sat and decided quickly wat all to order .
Can ' t comment anything about it ' s non veg portion as I am a veggie .
!!
Birthday the best day of my life .
I always loved the Karim ' s in Jama Masjid .
I ' ve visited once here .
Went at 12 midnight .
And couldn ' t believe it was full of crowd .
Went at 12 midnight .
And couldn ' t believe it was full of crowd .
.Went yesterday to try the restaurant..
.so we decided not to sit here but in there other section .
.. instead I got an answer " its just written in the menu but does not mean anything " i was quite surprised..
But thought let it go .
When I took the first bite I could get the taste was different .
So we called the waiter to confirm that whether this dish is vegetarian and he said yes , so we continued eating .
But after having few bites I was still doubtful .
So I called the chef and he said that it ' s non vegetarian .
The TOWNHOUSE .
My tip - 1.

Sarvana bhawan is located just opposite to mybar in cp in p block .
They gave us a table on the second floor .
I have been to naivedyam and sagar ratna before .
Remember to oblige
After a much publicized media hype around this restaurant , I decided to give them a try for a weekday dinner .
Hyderabad blues is located on the 5th floor of Reliance Classic Building in Road # 1.
The have a small take away counter in the ground floor as well .
Food review following up .
On a fine afternoon , me and colleagues were off with hectic schedule and thought to cool off with some good food : - ) Searched nearby places on Zomato and selected Pirates of Grill to be the place .
!!!
.
!
So plz try .
Pal dhaba !
!!!
!!!
Dil kush hota hai jab kuch dil ko touch kar jata hai !
I might be unlucky to get these .
We were greeted this sweet lady who was so patient with us .
I had initially planned to eat pao bhaji , but she explained that they are a franchise soon becoming a self owned place , named nini ' s kitchen .
The franchise had asked them to make pre - cooked pao bhaji and they rebelled and now they could work on their own terms .
And I wonder what they would do with the graffiti that has juice lounge written all over it .
Class of food .
!!
I booked a table for dinner and specified them that we are 10 adults and 2 children .
The person sitting at the end of the table had to pass his glass to the waiter serving water .
Yesterday we three people went to have some gupshup and experience the food here .
It was time for a family lunch and so this place was chosen .
And it surely is .
Speciality in that .
!!
.in fact I thought a tad bit more so !
Unsure why this place is trending in the top list .
!!
!
: )
If you are reading this review , chances are that you belong to the educated , moderately affluent , internet junkie category who is used to dining every now and then .
So brace yourself .
We had dinner at this charmingly difficult place to find .
..Now the main matter the food .
The most amazing view of bangalore metro , mg road and parade grounds .
Ordered in these guys when we were having a party at a friends place at Panchsheel enclave .
It was a drinking party so food wasn ' t the main focus .
This was one of the first few restaurants that I visited when i first came to Delhi .
Whenever I go to a place with such good ambiance somewhere I am mentally prepared to compromise on the taste of the food .
We chose to go to Lodi on a quiet breezy day of August .
It had been a super long time since only me and my husband went out for a meal alone , so it was date night .
Non intrusive yet very very alert .
.best suited for sunny winter sundays.. .
Lodi is ( obviously ) located on the lodi road , next to the Islamic Center near IHC .
Ask them for suggestions !
Thankfully the weather was on our side as well !
You find just two buttons one for the ground and the other for 30th floor , no pitstops in between ; ) As soon as we entered the place , we were flabbergasted..
The point is that the chef prepares everything with best efforts .
The place started to be fill in at around 11.00pm .
The pizzas there !
!
Smokin ' Joes is the only one that can come close but is still 2nd best .
Had been to yauatcha on a Sunday for lunch with family .
The recently deceased Ping Pong always operated in Yauatcha ' s shadow .
The chain in Bombay matches it standards all over the world .
BonAppetite
We usually go in early or else you may have to wait at the bar for a while which isn ' t too bad either .
We were not expecting seating immediately .
But was pleasantly surprised to be seated in minutes .
This place was on my bucket list since a very long time .
Finally got to have a taste of this place .
Restaurant in town...
We reached there early so were out early as well .
The name is very close to the Parasi culture .
So finally I ws here .
etc .
8 / 102 .
If you think parsi food is not for vegetarians - think again .
I hope these guys keep the quality levels up and do not get complacent : - )
Hoping the ambiance and taste of the food to be excellent .
Frankly I ' ve never tried anything else .
OK , I ' ll be honest ; I don ' t really remember what we ordered here .
Zippr code : YAXE8298
We are supposed to visit another restaurant but came here as there was heavy public in that restaurant .
Food : 2 / 5 ; ambience : 3.5 / 5 ; service : 2.5 / 5
Our first stop for the Food Connect organized by Zomato and DLF Cyber Hub .
I was pretty excited when I saw SBOW as one of the restaurants for foodie meet up .
Meeting the fellow foodies on Zomato , whom I only know by name was pretty exciting .
We were greeted the very bubbly team of Zomato .
The other reviewers from Zomato kept on joining and the conversations started .
they told us very interesting story about how they recreated it from the original one .
They told us that the dish is from Goa and had Portuguese influence .
Happy Eating Fellas !
First , Its hard to find a Parsi restaurant in NCR , Second , good food along with it is occasional .
I never been to Mumbai before where I assume I will find such restaurants in common .
So , I am reviewing Parsi food as a virgin .
After a long time I happen to catch up with my friends and wanted to do Hukka .
Odeon in CP .
The only drawback being that it gets difficult to get a table if you are with a group of stags !
!
Though I went in the afternoon of a hot day and hence could not sit outside .
That ' s what we did .
I ' m not even kidding .
Took my team out to Air Cafe Lounge .
Air lounge is located in roadno.36 , jubliee hills !
Currently it has the alcohol license for weekends and very soon they will acquire it for weekdays as well .
Who does that ?
Still , as ratings go , i would give3.5 / 5 for ambience , 2.5 / 5 for food , 3.5 / 5 for bang for the buck .
Me and my friend went for lunch at there Beltola outlet .
So I won ' t be able to judge better .
This is my first chingri biryani .
Visited the place the day before yesterday and could not stop myself writing my feelings post the same .
However when I visited the Beltola joint , I was amazed .
This is probably the first hookah parlours ' in guwahati .
Friends , post - dinner hunger thus shiv Sagar .
.
n man .
.

!!
Bliss !
!
I would have waited another hour to eat here .
Bombay brasserie : *
Not the best with designs .
I basically don ' t smoke and don ' t drink .
.
We almost spent 5 hours .
..
Go here
.
If we sit simply waiting for them to refill means they will come late ...
.
.
!
!

This is my 2am place .
So this review is short and sweet .
.....
.
Thursday a good day to go .
.lets b honest , dere is no point showing loyalty to dis place n persons who doesnt care abt VFM fundas can go bck again n again .
It is located on the 9th floor of Hotel Lindsay ( now renamed to The Lindsay !
) .
Want to try a new place ?
, .
?
?
?
The restaurant shall evaluate making portions for one person only along with decreasing the rates .

and mostly for right reasons .

As some correctly say , over a cup of coffee lots of things happen !
That ' s what happened with me .
.. .
Four of us went to Smoke House Deli sometime back simply because the reviews were great and we had heard so much about the place .
Location : Jaipur Marriott Hotel .
Valet Parking always available .
I don ' t know if they still serve it or not .
The variety of breads and spreads on offer is really .
Recommended ?
My friends took me to the place .
Had dinner here .
Me and a friend of mine had been planning to try this place for a long time now and we eventually made it there .

You won ' t feel like you ' re in Pune .
I had gone to the flying elephant a few days back !
.
We went to this place with high expectations .
The elevator that gets you to the lounge shows you what height you are at for every floor and your excitement builds .
But owing to the fact that Bangalore does not have a skyline , the height is not utilised at all .
A place at this height in Mumbai would have been much better .
!
Because of great weather only the outside area was operational .
: P
The place started filling at 10 : 30 as the entry is less before 11pm .
But they will lose in the long run .
So , I prefer Skyye !

A DJ - yes !
Choice of drinks ?

Both black and green !
Read the reviews and decided to dine out yesterday .
..
.
.
..
Though I am writing this review a bit late ...
But as it is said it is better late than never..
I hosted a party for 30 pax .
..
I visited Delhi last year as my cousin works there .
As i was roaming at DLF Place i found out this cafe which i have heard a lot about .
Went to the restaurant on a sunday afternoon .
I thought to try this cafe and when i visited there , the place is full of ambience and music , a bit of crowd .
They noticed !
They opened , we got a table for 3.
1.

Where do i start...trying going on an empty stomach so that you can taste everything tht is being served there .
Only positive things to say !
Had been here on August 31st with my love for celebrating our 3rd anniversary .
Thanks for that !
Came here for lunch today .
: )
.. .
.
.
.
A place for Bengali food loves and even those who do not like it much are also sure to fall in love with it .
.
People at first even I was like " whats the point of having bengali food outside home ?
Oh !
We ordered our drinks and got chatting with the gentleman making our cocktails ( who we later realised was the owner ) .
) we ordered were taking a while .
.
.
.
.
We went for a reunion and one of had a fast that day , she was supposed to eat just fried potatoes with no salt .
We were all amazed and it did not end there .
...
Visited this place on basis of reviews .
I went to this place on a Sunday night .
RUDE !
RUDE !
RUDE !
!!
!
!
.
!My friends n I were very hungry and happened to visit this place on a Saturday afternoon .
So you can understand the feeling !
!
I have been a regular customer of this place since 2001 .
This place is more of a drinking and less for eating types... We sat outside and there was not a single table without a cigarette in hand .
..
.
.
!!
.
We had asked whether reservations can be made a couple of days before we visited the place .
We then asked him to call his senior .
?
Ya kam ho gayi ?
No kidding .
The friend who offered to share this with you will say " oh that sounds like it ' ll be too heavy " .
Trust me .
You need to try this .
You ' re killing me .
At least during the day time .
Probably need to check the place after 5 - the dhaba part opens in the eve only .
If you visit this place on NEw Year day , trust me you may not be able to place order as the the flood of foodies is at its peak extending to the main road .
.!!
Since we went there for the first time , I requested the attendant to surprise us with three of their best dishes .

!This concludes my review for Jamjar and yes If this review gets to Jamjar , gimme a near messy beef burger next time when im in , Ill ask for it .

The first time was new year ' s eve , and the second on a Karaoke night ( Wednesdays ) .
It is not on their menu for good reasons .
How come , still a three ?
.
.
See pic attached .
.
.
.. .
...overall a good experience
Not sure if it qualifies as true Burmese but it felt like it was Indo / Chinese / Thai inspired .
We went strictly by the waiter ' s recommendations .
.. looking at food going to other tables it looks like the suggest the same few items to all !
I saw a lot of pizza boxes piled up besides the tables where we sat .
!
.
.
But waiting for few mins will surely get ur table .
.
.
!
!
Entry is lonely and you can ' t make out if there is a lounge inside , all you can see is a big ' coming soon ' board outside the mall .
The good thing is that they are having introductory offer i.e.
It is hidden out of view from the main street but certainly al over the place when you reach there .
And ( like us ) you may forgiven to think that the name implies another cafe like lounge that serves beer towers to the gypsy twenties - something socialite .
The answer ' s no !
We went for dinner on Saturday .
I have had friends and family telling me that if they went there without a reservation , they were given a table , but i was refused bookings seven days in advance too !
Lets start with getting a table .
When i called them they wre booked for a friday nite but yet i thought of giving it a try .
When reaching there i manage to get a table for 4 after waiting for 10 mins .
: )
A lady named Priyanka was kind enough to get us a table a day before .
True to it ' s name , Little Italy offers you everything you can possibly expect at an Italian restaurant .
It was not what we had in mind .
!!!
!
.
...
?
?
?
?
!
.
That ' s some relief !
And thankfully no under age doings happen here as they are very strict about checking IDs right at the entrance .
.
Man man man !
!
..i informed them too before .
!
!
!
!
..
That sums up my experience in Tao .
.
Believe you me .
?
?
I went to this place only coz I cudnt get tables in barbeque nation .
What ' s obviously missing is for this city to allow the best ever chain to serve beer and cocktails .
.
As i went to phoenix today to visit Hewlett Packard in search for a laptop , i ended up starving and wandering the food court of Phoenix .
..
..
.
I take a tour of all the stuff that has been collected over the years .
.
.
May it be soccer , cricket , hockey .
.!!
As usual tradiion of Katani remain same .
Its just i felt about may be that was for the same day i visited .
even though you can find the similar taste here too , but something makes a difference .
Being a veggie , I really can ' t comment on much of the menu .
Recommended only if ur not in for dominoes / Pizza Hut .
In punjabbi ...... Kaimmm aa kaimm
So , visit Hot Millions 2 , 1 and Salad Bar .
The HM & amp ; Salad Bar and the Ground Floor HM are two entirely Different Places , Both in terms of ambiance and price .
But if you want to have a budgeted meal , go to the ground floor .
!
!
Wtf !
!
reached just before happy hours end We ordered some dears but they limit us to order only less because happy hour going to end .
it didn ' t make sense to us .
Been here recently in April 2014 .
Drinks are bit cheaper compared to other discotheques in pune .
It seems there is no club rules and everyone is allowed .
Damage : Stag Entry Rs 1000 and couple also for Rs 1000 .
Even in peak times !
!
!
!U Can visit if a big Foodie !
: D
About 20 of us had dinner here !
.
; )
!
Since when losers ?
Effing place !
!
My shorts is more expensive than their pants .
..
Somehow it slept out of my mind and I called them at two in afternoon for table booking .
They were closed for any bookings but they asked us to reach by 7.30 so that we will be getting table .
Me and my brother reached and for our surprize there were only few table left to be filled .
we had to call for the starters .
.
.
So there is a lot to choose from for everybody .
.
.
.
..
It ' s alright !
!!!
We did planned that we are going to checkout the place so we wont be spending much .
!
!
.
.
..
.
....being Jain dint get any thing new to try .
..... .
What ?
They should be reserving only a selected number of tables in advance and leave the rest for walk in guests .
!!
Haha !
!
!
.
.
We just happened to go there one Saturday evening .
Anyways let ' s get to the point .
Food .
Blimey !
!

: )
How do i know ?
Even Hot Cross Buns was almost equivalent .
.
?
?
?
.for 4 days .
.wish you could send to us in Mumbai.
.
However , as it is a " bakery " , if we have to rate the bakery items , it certainly deserves a 4.5 star .
No review .
I am not a very big fan of Indian food when I am dining out .
.. but once in a long while I wished to try some Indian food .

This is a dog eat dog world .

Their is something special about the whole pandara road market and nearby khan market .
That it is located in the posh area of Delhi only adds to the whole experience .
The poor things who are raving about these dishes havent had the chance to taste the authentic stuff.
Gulati...

Lets rock @ Gangsta , Bandra near natioanl college
Walked in on a Friday night to find the place bustling with people all ready to get their drink on .
..got really packed post 1...few starlets nd strugglers hanging around on d edge of d dancefloor...bachelorette parties .
.
bdays...nd kitty party aunties out dancing was the general type of crowd that night .
..Thanks Sudeep fr the tour nd the absolutely amazing pizza.
.
But it had a stage , they must be having music shows on weekends , alas I went on a weekday .

Is Batman so Garib in India .
I would like to suggest that people should prefer to go for Night Owl instead of Batman .
Why they chose to hire him is beyond me .
Boom !
Pow !
Whoosh !
Uggh !
These pop ups are synonymous with the Batman series which used to come on TV .
partying with friends ) , the house party will go on further for at least a couple of hours , the initial plates of biryani have been gobbled up in a jiffy and suddenly hunger strikes !
.
Who should you call ?
Batman Delivers .
And apart from food , they have other stuff also which they can deliver .
I don ' t know where is the DEN for this BATMAN but sure it delivered food .
Coming to the food .
The funniest part is you can ask the delivery guy , " Are you BATMAN ?
HAHA
Now what to say about Batman .
Order booked at 11 : 40pmReceived hot food at 12 : 15am .
: )
Pleasant , isn ' t it ?
( : Well this one is nothing like it .
My guess is that have been changed recently .
: )
What is there to say ?
It ' s a dhaba .
You don ' t go for the service or the ambience .
There are scooters parked mainly and you will have to stand and have your food which is the main reason why people prefer take away .
The place has its AC restaurant with it by name RAJINDER XPRESS .
But if you truly want the place ' s true taste , try it having it outside .
The place also has one more zone in the back of the enclave .
Many a times I passed this place and couldn ' t go due to reasons .
This time I went to drop my sister and squeezed some time to get a parcel .
.
.
The only word that can define it !

Getting up to the restaurant is a task though .

Gud deals are available
I went there on tuesday night around 7 : 30 .
Here on zomato it says that happy hours on tuesday are till 8 pm .
But we were told that they are only till 7.
So to sum it all up .
.
People tend to eat while drinking .
went there for lunch.
then came the test .
FANTASTIC Sunday afternoon .
My son says .
.
.
I ordered a drink which wasn ' t available , had to stay happy with some other drink instead .
.
.. You d Sure end up spending it though .
..
.
...We wish to njoy a pre planned table seating experience next time ; ) All the best .
Didn ' t have the food .
Apart from this , they have these small contests like drink 6 shot glasses of beer with a straw in 20 seconds and get a beer for free .
Waiting !
!!
..so choose wisely because you will b lucky if you ' d be able to switch seats .
I asked them the reason for it they said that they have a bar which is near the dining area ( got d hint dat this place is basically for drinking and not for food ) .Requested them to allow us with the child as it was too early and would leave the place in a hour .
Ka bhaiyya who was hired a few days back .
..I miss that place so much .
But unfortunately it ' s place has been taken by GARBAGE ' 69 ( no pun intended ) Management u can argue on dis m game .
..cauz u ' ll r just fooling ppl .

I went with high hope to this place .
I had expected the appetizer to be fried with oil in it .
I ' ll explain anyway - firstly , the food ( obviously ) !
.
with my insatiable appetite for desserts and their rather appealing list , there was no way I was leaving without trying one .
that was the first time I went there !
my best wishes for TL !
