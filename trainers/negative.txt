There were just 2-3 tables occupied excluding mine, still the order took time.
I did not like it.
Sweetness was way below the appropriate value and I found its taste really odd.
Things that bother: It's and the main road and I always have problems finding place to park car.
I've rarely seen people eating meals here, so I am not sure why they have these options.
On the upside, muffins, possible the only tea accompaniment they serve, are surprisingly good, though, they work well because they are actually not muffins and more like tea cakes!
