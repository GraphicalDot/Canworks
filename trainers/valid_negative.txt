Other than that the staff was polite but were not able suggest anything from the menu .
Their sides could do with some improvement though .
The garlic bread especially could do with a lot more garlic and a bit less crunch .
HOWEVER , the last time I visited ( a few weeks ago ) , I was very put off by the flies that were constantly buzzing around and sitting at our table .
Despite complaining to the waiter , no one seemed to want to move them .
As this was a takeaway order , a service charge is not expected on the billed amount .
When asked , was told that this is packaging charge .
However , a 10 % service charge was added to the bill .
This needs to be clearly mentioned as packaging cost .
How can a packaging charge and service charge be the same ?
I actually didnt enjoy either... Chinese and indian alike tasted extremely bland and i probably would not have eaten if i wasnt so hungry from all the drinking .
Never seen that in any premium restaurants .
Please clarify your stand .
Pricing , is a bit tad expensive on some drinks but if you ' re lucky , ending up with some deals on drinks would be a welcome .
It ' s a bit pricey though .
Only one area which upset all 6 of us was the attitude of the waiters .
Need to work on main course .
they dont have much options in veg starters & amp ; non veg starters are very average !
The waiters dont have serving etiquettes at all .
The main course was below average with just 2 dal , 1 veggi & amp ; 1 non veg dish .
We left the table without eating our desert .
Not the perfect ambience and the food they serve is not properly cooked .
Now , they have made the gravies very spicy , use cheap oils and bad quality meat .
It was ok , not great and the price range was quite high for all the products .
Now the taste has gone but ppl still pour in just for the name ' s sake .
Was a big name in South Delhi for its ever famous delicious roasted chicken and kebabs .
For those who have any idea or taste of Mughlai Food , this restaurant is not a place to visit .
Like most chains that come to India this too is disappointing .
The space is rather strange with people hanging around outside watching you eat like you ' re in a lab experiment .
Coming to the food , the only real reason one goes out to eat , was certainly not up to the mark .
The food lacked energy and depth .
There were too many ingredients that over powered each other .
Wouldn ' t go back there or recommend it to anyone .
The service is very very slow , though you did make it up with a smiley ketchup plate : ) 3.
For the kind of burgers you are selling , you are overcharging the people .
You have meal options , which are pretty tempting but the way your items are priced is a big dampener .
Try it once , for the heck of it .
Okay so the newly opened American diner - Johnny Rockets didn ' t really touch my happy spot .
The sour dough of the burger doesn ' t do much for me .
Overall the burger was bland and it didn ' t really stay together since it was pretty dry .
Whereas the double bacon cheddar was a little better than the Houston expect this place has more room for improvement .
I could not taste the ' red ' sauce it was supposed to have .
The taste was strictly ok... is this the famed American burger ?
The waiter had initially served me a veg burger but before I could take a bite she realized the mistake and brought the correct one .
They dont deliver complete order .
But the menu on the buffet is not at all worth for the money you pay for the food .
But the place and the food is OVER - RATED .
But the place and the food is OVER - RATED .
..was expecting much more from the place .
there are better places .
It looks they are in real hurry and serves dishes so fast as if you have to vacate the seat for more guests .
The kebabs are not as good as they are at Radisson .
For those who have any idea or taste of Mughlai Food , this restaurant is not a place to visit .
You will be making fool of yourself if you will visit the place with great expectation for Mughlai food .
Not a single non - veg dish is worth mentioning .
These people are cheating on you in the name of Mughlai food .
Better visit Karims at Nizamuddin ( Nizamuddin only ) for a great and authentic taste of Mughlai food .
Moreover , veg snacks were not at all served to the ones who opted for Non - veg.and when we asked to repeat a starter , they said its finished !
Try BarBeQue Nation , the food is much better and gives you better value for money .
Moreover , there was nothing good about the ambience and the seats were also not comfortable .
No Complimentary Beverage : ( I think Barbecue Nation is a better option : )
But I would say main course and desserts needs little attension here .
We visited this place last friday and that is one of the biggest mistake in terms of choosing the right place .
We wasted good amount of money and time there and end up with dissatisfaction oozing to our brim .
It used to be one of my favorite places of all times .
Pull up your socks !
Instead u can barbeque nation if u want to have these a lot as tat can be in budget !
Loved Makai Seekh , Burrah Kebab was under cooked and not as soft as it should be .
Main Course we ordered Murg Makhani , Dal Makhani , Plain NaanMain course was OK kind of but i expected a wow effect after eating the food because i was hungry .
As for ambiance ..their is no ambiance as such .
Not tasty at all .
No other non - veg dish .
Though I dont really care about the money but atleast the food should have been worth the money .
I am not too sure about the mixed vege curry .
Pure punjab...the food n the ambience doesn ' t support the name .
Menu prices exceed the level of expectation from the food !
What really * DID * suck was the service .
Overpriced things .
My rating would have been a big - ve if the option existed on Zomato .
Snails crawl faster.2.
A requested and confirmed dish was overlooked and not served ( not charged too ) .
Shows a big hygiene issue .
No apologies tendered .
So I really wonder what is the hype around Nando ' s all about .
I would just say that the burger was decent nothing great , but I would suggest don ' t try lemon & amp ; heb chicken because its close to be be being bland , it seems to have no chilly , salt nothing and no taste of lemon too !
I didn ' t see much of a difference in both than just th chilli sauce .
Overall I just wanted to try it once but noithing spectacular that I would want to go back to .
My 3rd visit to Nandos , and I ' m saying , so what ' s all the fuss about !
Despite the waiting , me and sonny were quickly seated , but in a very tight spot with barely any elbow space .
However , i don ' t think its value for money .
That ' s 900 per head , so not value for money .
Service is quick , but had to keep craning my neck toget the attention of servers , for add ons , water etc .
May not be runnin , g back , despite the loyalty cards they are giving out now .
Although they need to work on managing clean tables and bulk orders on busy days .
However the ambience is rather compromised .
Nor the store management engaging such customers .
Maybe I had very high expectation from this place but there was no wow factor at all .
Being a Veg , i had a very low expectation from it .
The Inorbit Mumbai was below par .
Expensive for the kind of food they serve .
To add on to this , was amazed to find the service staff behaving unprofessionally with the customers and I got a feel that we were obliged to them and not them to us !
!Would never recommend this place to anyone !
though the food was alright , the service was slow.we left with pounding headaches from the music and sore throats from having to shout to make conversation .
Parking is ' orrible in this area in general .
Only problem is with the music ( they r not playing songs on demand , which if they can , one can definitely enjoy the food with music of his own choice ) .
Service isn ' t impressive .
But I wonder how will people occupy the terrace in this scorching heat ?
..lacked in flavour .
..15 minutes to bring the menu card .
.. had to get up from my seat to ask the waiter to offer the same to me .
.. once I ordered... a Beer - corona... it takes another 9mins for them to bring it that too without the lemon wedge which I believe every restaurant in India offers .
.. another 5 mins to bring the lemon... which is now bigger than what can fit into the bottle .
.. takes 8 minutes for him to walk up to me and in the middle another guest stops him to complain and he starts solving their issue .
.. and goes back to ensure tht complaint is handled first...
It took us 1 hour to get the table .
However , one thing that I would like to object to is their new policy of not allowing children before 10 : 00 PM for dinner .
I was expecting the food to be too delicious and finger licking , it was not as per the expectations .
.i was expecting to wait but surprisingly the place was half full it is definitely over priced and overrated .
I for one think that there are better options on the city .
The american indian friend of mine really had a hard tome communicating with the staff luckily i was there to help out with the ordering .
All in all we paid a bill of almost Rs 20 , 000 .
To say the truth we all felt a bit cheated after leaving the place ,
My main gripe with this place is that the seating is not very comfortable especially if you are not seated with your back towards the walls for support .
Also it can bit a noisy as the place fills up but it ' s overall bearable .
A bit too costly but after the meal you ' ll be happy to pay .
While the shimla mirch dish was good , the daal was no where close to the hype created about it .
Quite frankly , I had a better Daal at karnal haveli the same day .
Over hyped food .
And look after their customers rather than just making business
Better Dal is available in many places in Delhi .
Hey , when you charge the earth for your food , is it not your duty to give delicious food ?
I was resisting going to Bukhara - ITC Maurya for so many reasons .
Reason 1 : People say it is overrated .
Kung Pao Chicken is okay but avoid the konjee crispy lamb as it is always soft .
Not Recommended at all
The server could not help much on this aspect .
..The place is not as great as their food but still it is an average and quite decent place to have dinner with your friends and family .
It is not a fancy place and does not have a great ambiance , but who goes to alkauzer for its ambiance !
Indoor Sitting is small so its best either to take - away your food or have it outside .
You need to look for the entrance of this place .
These cookies are my favourite pick , i can have them packed and can warm it and eat them , but quite high on price for a 100 gm cookies you get around 5 - 6 pieces , cannot afford on every visit i pay here .
The Angels in their kitchen seem to be snoozing or on vacation for sometime !
Come on guys ; you can do a lot better .
..Yes it is a bit over priced .
The service sucked big time , till 15 mins no one was even bothered to take the order .
My expectations were much higher .
Felt like they were doing a favour serving food .
I went there on a busy Saturday evening when the waiters and managers are quite busy shuffling dishes from table to table .
One can give the staff ' s negligence a passe ' keeping in mind that the food arrives pretty fast and the taste is outstanding .
.. everythn u will find interesting.. der is only one which will hurt u is the less quantity and taxes dey charge .
There is nothing soothing about your ambience , just getting the lights dim and showing IPL matches on a non - HD TV doesnt work .
You are too overpriced considering the quantity you serve at this price .
And also rename the section of mocktails to refined REAL juice because thats how exactly two different mocktails ( Cosmo not and Shaken not stired ) tasted like .
- 1 for the food waiting time which was almost 15 minutes .
Food : this is where it began to disappoint as the flavours were only till outer skin and it seems like under marinated .
The side dishes and the salads do not provide the kind of joy that their chicken does .
The staff and service could be better in terms of ambient noise.
Bcoz i am a vegetarian so no for me .
Not of my personal taste .
Kfc is better if you wanna chicken .
Avoid visiting this place .
Rates are high .
..Service could have been little better .
