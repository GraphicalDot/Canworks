Other than that the staff was polite but were not able suggest anything from the menu .
Their sides could do with some improvement though .
The garlic bread especially could do with a lot more garlic and a bit less crunch .
HOWEVER , the last time I visited ( a few weeks ago ) , I was very put off by the flies that were constantly buzzing around and sitting at our table .
Despite complaining to the waiter , no one seemed to want to move them .
As this was a takeaway order , a service charge is not expected on the billed amount .
When asked , was told that this is packaging charge .
However , a 10 % service charge was added to the bill .
This needs to be clearly mentioned as packaging cost .
How can a packaging charge and service charge be the same ?
I actually didnt enjoy either... Chinese and indian alike tasted extremely bland and i probably would not have eaten if i wasnt so hungry from all the drinking .
Never seen that in any premium restaurants .
Please clarify your stand .
Pricing , is a bit tad expensive on some drinks but if you ' re lucky , ending up with some deals on drinks would be a welcome .
It ' s a bit pricey though .
Only one area which upset all 6 of us was the attitude of the waiters .
Need to work on main course .
they dont have much options in veg starters & amp ; non veg starters are very average !
The waiters dont have serving etiquettes at all .
The main course was below average with just 2 dal , 1 veggi & amp ; 1 non veg dish .
We left the table without eating our desert .
Not the perfect ambience and the food they serve is not properly cooked .
Now , they have made the gravies very spicy , use cheap oils and bad quality meat .
It was ok , not great and the price range was quite high for all the products .
Now the taste has gone but ppl still pour in just for the name ' s sake .
Was a big name in South Delhi for its ever famous delicious roasted chicken and kebabs .
For those who have any idea or taste of Mughlai Food , this restaurant is not a place to visit .
Like most chains that come to India this too is disappointing .
The space is rather strange with people hanging around outside watching you eat like you ' re in a lab experiment .
Coming to the food , the only real reason one goes out to eat , was certainly not up to the mark .
The food lacked energy and depth .
There were too many ingredients that over powered each other .
Wouldn ' t go back there or recommend it to anyone .
The service is very very slow , though you did make it up with a smiley ketchup plate : ) 3.
For the kind of burgers you are selling , you are overcharging the people .
You have meal options , which are pretty tempting but the way your items are priced is a big dampener .
Try it once , for the heck of it .
Okay so the newly opened American diner - Johnny Rockets didn ' t really touch my happy spot .
The sour dough of the burger doesn ' t do much for me .
Overall the burger was bland and it didn ' t really stay together since it was pretty dry .
Whereas the double bacon cheddar was a little better than the Houston expect this place has more room for improvement .
I could not taste the ' red ' sauce it was supposed to have .
The taste was strictly ok... is this the famed American burger ?
The waiter had initially served me a veg burger but before I could take a bite she realized the mistake and brought the correct one .
They dont deliver complete order .
But the menu on the buffet is not at all worth for the money you pay for the food .
But the place and the food is OVER - RATED .
But the place and the food is OVER - RATED .
..was expecting much more from the place .
there are better places .
It looks they are in real hurry and serves dishes so fast as if you have to vacate the seat for more guests .
The kebabs are not as good as they are at Radisson .
For those who have any idea or taste of Mughlai Food , this restaurant is not a place to visit .
You will be making fool of yourself if you will visit the place with great expectation for Mughlai food .
Not a single non - veg dish is worth mentioning .
These people are cheating on you in the name of Mughlai food .
Better visit Karims at Nizamuddin ( Nizamuddin only ) for a great and authentic taste of Mughlai food .
Moreover , veg snacks were not at all served to the ones who opted for Non - veg.and when we asked to repeat a starter , they said its finished !
Try BarBeQue Nation , the food is much better and gives you better value for money .
Moreover , there was nothing good about the ambience and the seats were also not comfortable .
No Complimentary Beverage : ( I think Barbecue Nation is a better option : )
But I would say main course and desserts needs little attension here .
We visited this place last friday and that is one of the biggest mistake in terms of choosing the right place .
We wasted good amount of money and time there and end up with dissatisfaction oozing to our brim .
It used to be one of my favorite places of all times .
Pull up your socks !
Instead u can barbeque nation if u want to have these a lot as tat can be in budget !
Loved Makai Seekh , Burrah Kebab was under cooked and not as soft as it should be .
Main Course we ordered Murg Makhani , Dal Makhani , Plain NaanMain course was OK kind of but i expected a wow effect after eating the food because i was hungry .
As for ambiance ..their is no ambiance as such .
Not tasty at all .
No other non - veg dish .
Though I dont really care about the money but atleast the food should have been worth the money .
I am not too sure about the mixed vege curry .
Pure punjab...the food n the ambience doesn ' t support the name .
Menu prices exceed the level of expectation from the food !
What really * DID * suck was the service .
Overpriced things .
My rating would have been a big - ve if the option existed on Zomato .
Snails crawl faster.2.
A requested and confirmed dish was overlooked and not served ( not charged too ) .
Shows a big hygiene issue .
No apologies tendered .
So I really wonder what is the hype around Nando ' s all about .
I would just say that the burger was decent nothing great , but I would suggest don ' t try lemon & amp ; heb chicken because its close to be be being bland , it seems to have no chilly , salt nothing and no taste of lemon too !
I didn ' t see much of a difference in both than just th chilli sauce .
Overall I just wanted to try it once but noithing spectacular that I would want to go back to .
My 3rd visit to Nandos , and I ' m saying , so what ' s all the fuss about !
Despite the waiting , me and sonny were quickly seated , but in a very tight spot with barely any elbow space .
However , i don ' t think its value for money .
That ' s 900 per head , so not value for money .
Service is quick , but had to keep craning my neck toget the attention of servers , for add ons , water etc .
May not be runnin , g back , despite the loyalty cards they are giving out now .
Although they need to work on managing clean tables and bulk orders on busy days .
However the ambience is rather compromised .
Nor the store management engaging such customers .
Maybe I had very high expectation from this place but there was no wow factor at all .
Being a Veg , i had a very low expectation from it .
The Inorbit Mumbai was below par .
Expensive for the kind of food they serve .
To add on to this , was amazed to find the service staff behaving unprofessionally with the customers and I got a feel that we were obliged to them and not them to us !
!Would never recommend this place to anyone !
though the food was alright , the service was slow.we left with pounding headaches from the music and sore throats from having to shout to make conversation .
Parking is ' orrible in this area in general .
Only problem is with the music ( they r not playing songs on demand , which if they can , one can definitely enjoy the food with music of his own choice ) .
Service isn ' t impressive .
But I wonder how will people occupy the terrace in this scorching heat ?
..lacked in flavour .
..15 minutes to bring the menu card .
.. had to get up from my seat to ask the waiter to offer the same to me .
.. once I ordered... a Beer - corona... it takes another 9mins for them to bring it that too without the lemon wedge which I believe every restaurant in India offers .
.. another 5 mins to bring the lemon... which is now bigger than what can fit into the bottle .
.. takes 8 minutes for him to walk up to me and in the middle another guest stops him to complain and he starts solving their issue .
.. and goes back to ensure tht complaint is handled first...
It took us 1 hour to get the table .
However , one thing that I would like to object to is their new policy of not allowing children before 10 : 00 PM for dinner .
I was expecting the food to be too delicious and finger licking , it was not as per the expectations .
.i was expecting to wait but surprisingly the place was half full it is definitely over priced and overrated .
I for one think that there are better options on the city .
The american indian friend of mine really had a hard tome communicating with the staff luckily i was there to help out with the ordering .
All in all we paid a bill of almost Rs 20 , 000 .
To say the truth we all felt a bit cheated after leaving the place ,
My main gripe with this place is that the seating is not very comfortable especially if you are not seated with your back towards the walls for support .
Also it can bit a noisy as the place fills up but it ' s overall bearable .
A bit too costly but after the meal you ' ll be happy to pay .
While the shimla mirch dish was good , the daal was no where close to the hype created about it .
Quite frankly , I had a better Daal at karnal haveli the same day .
Over hyped food .
And look after their customers rather than just making business
Better Dal is available in many places in Delhi .
Hey , when you charge the earth for your food , is it not your duty to give delicious food ?
I was resisting going to Bukhara - ITC Maurya for so many reasons .
Reason 1 : People say it is overrated .
Kung Pao Chicken is okay but avoid the konjee crispy lamb as it is always soft .
Not Recommended at all
The server could not help much on this aspect .
..The place is not as great as their food but still it is an average and quite decent place to have dinner with your friends and family .
It is not a fancy place and does not have a great ambiance , but who goes to alkauzer for its ambiance !
Indoor Sitting is small so its best either to take - away your food or have it outside .
You need to look for the entrance of this place .
These cookies are my favourite pick , i can have them packed and can warm it and eat them , but quite high on price for a 100 gm cookies you get around 5 - 6 pieces , cannot afford on every visit i pay here .
The Angels in their kitchen seem to be snoozing or on vacation for sometime !
Come on guys ; you can do a lot better .
..Yes it is a bit over priced .
The service sucked big time , till 15 mins no one was even bothered to take the order .
My expectations were much higher .
Felt like they were doing a favour serving food .
I went there on a busy Saturday evening when the waiters and managers are quite busy shuffling dishes from table to table .
One can give the staff ' s negligence a passe ' keeping in mind that the food arrives pretty fast and the taste is outstanding .
.. everythn u will find interesting.. der is only one which will hurt u is the less quantity and taxes dey charge .
There is nothing soothing about your ambience , just getting the lights dim and showing IPL matches on a non - HD TV doesnt work .
You are too overpriced considering the quantity you serve at this price .
And also rename the section of mocktails to refined REAL juice because thats how exactly two different mocktails ( Cosmo not and Shaken not stired ) tasted like .
- 1 for the food waiting time which was almost 15 minutes .
Food : this is where it began to disappoint as the flavours were only till outer skin and it seems like under marinated .
The side dishes and the salads do not provide the kind of joy that their chicken does .
The staff and service could be better in terms of ambient noise.
Bcoz i am a vegetarian so no for me .
Not of my personal taste .
Kfc is better if you wanna chicken .
Avoid visiting this place .
Rates are high .
..Service could have been little better .
Although when you are on the gate of it , the entrance is not that good .
You might just ignore it and walk away .
The hookah was a bit costly ( starts from 1000 bucks + taxes ) but rest was ok .
.not great .
I didnt liked this kfc much
What place was this ?
Claims to serve Bengali food .
But what a shame .
Let me highlight disasters pertaining to each of the dishes .
Aloo posto didn ' t have any posto ( poppy seeds paste ) .
It was some fried fish definitely not ilish in a very oily spicy mustard gravy served over banana leaf .
What a disaster .
Jhingri malai curry was also very very oily and spicy .
Please refrain even if this is the only option for food .
The over hyped place in village dese days .
But then upon entering also , we are asked to wait for another 5 min so that the people sitting before us can pay their bill .
Management needs to tackle the human resource problem .
Even on a weekday I got tacky service .
The place is not cozy or the way it should be for dining .
.i wish they had more of chicken starters on the food menu..Ambience - 4.5 / 5Service - 5 / 5Food - 3.5 / 5
With a so hyped name nothing great about it .
..As the restaurant was not full..it took the waiter almost 20 min before we called him and asked if possible plz take the order .
.and when i told I can ' t have Chinese dish it was replied its a conti dish with bell pepper and some spices..
He said I ' ll cancel your order but please don ' t tell anybody .
Though fine music was playing but I found the relatively less cheerful .
Those who are used to north Indian flavors in south Indian food might not be fully satisfied.
I visited this joint with a friend and found it preety gloomy inside .
The service took about 20 minutes and the food served was not even hot .
Service was bit laggy this time .
pannchavarna utthappam , which is recommended in zomato was not that good .
pannchavarna utthappam , which is recommended in zomato was not that good .
Service was bit laggy this time .
Went der at nyt around 9 bt had to wait till 10 for seats .
..was very much crowded...masala dosa was good even all chutneys...bt i would prefer sagar ratna over dis place .
Surprisingly , the entire restaurant was empty and we were the only ones at 9 : 30PM .
The emphasis on blue was so much that all the pictures clicked came in blue shade .
Pizza was off smelling , not stored properly or prepared in rancid oil .
Pasta was bland in taste and flavours yet with good quality to eat .
Wasn ' t comfortable to eat and again bland .
I suggest they shud concentrate on taste .
...don ' t go .
most irritating part of it is they dont take table booking and u need to stand in a long waiting queue .
Bit costly for foodies .
The problem though is that they don ' t have any arrangement to keep the cheese warm .
So , once its cold , it doesn ' t taste as good anymore .
Cost a bit on the higher side .
There should be more variety .
Prices are high .
The biryani can be avoided .
But way overpriced IMHO .
price increased...per bottle 40 rs .
Nothing really special apart from a regular bar .
The music was ok no particular genre as such and quite honestly i felt over dressed !
They have boiled eggs as an appetizer option !
The service was ok. and they seemed to run short of Thandi beer !
We just picked up a couple of drinks - Beer and planters punch and a very spicy chilli infested masala papad and were out .
...Did not find any girls in this place and tharkey type men looming around .
I have just one suggestion for owner to change his theme from bar to a lounge and train your staff to be more polite to customers
!Time doesn ' t matter as interior is dark and dim light .
i went there with my female friend and there were too many male and over aged people , No young crowd.food quality - okLiquor rates are reasonable .
Service - oki ' ll rate it 2.. .
But definitely not a place for a date coz its a restro - bar kind & amp ; crowdy too
About the crowd or gentry i cant say much coz when i went to this place it was almost empty .
The oily , sweaty , grimy experience cannot match upto any fine dining .
Probably I could have rated it better if it wasn ' t for lunch that I was looking for .
We ended up shelling close to 2k each for food that we enjoyed to some extent and a pint each and overprized sheesha .
We ordered sheesha as well but should have checked the price first.. Also happy hours on IMFL only wasn ' t a turn on either .
A waiter will always be checking on you and they will not let you sit idle for a long time .
The tricky thing is the cuisine .
If you are not used to the bland taste or rather , if you love spices , the food could be a turn down .
Food is nothing to write about .
Need to change on sound a lot , till then its not a place to go .
.service can be better .
Service needs improvement .
On entering we were given the menu about five minutes later that too on asking for it .
no taste in food .
I really hope they make the service quicker and outlets bigger !
Deserts are not as good as the food , but the macroons are simply sinful .
The biggest negatives for me were the service and the place was very noisy !
You walk out of this restaurant with a hole in your pocket but also with a feeling of contentment .
The one thing that I dislike of the place is the noise level although it ' s not really the fault of the place but they could space out the tables more so as to avoid you being able to hear what ' s going on next door .
...but the quantity is low .
We reached there without a reservation in a Saturday night .
Just pricey though .
Dont bother eating anything which claims to be made in tomatoes .
The price is a little on the higher side per dish so remember to go in a group .
Helpings arent big either .
We nearly waited for 10 mins between food as it is a buffet served on the table did not understand the concept .
It really pinched me the money I wasted in Urban Asia .
A bit overpriced menu .
Food however was nowhere near taste .
Seemed like was prepared hours ago , was warmed up and served .
Rating 5 / 10I am not planning to visit again .
Ambience is okay and starters and all are good but i should say about biryani ( mutton ) which is awful ( atleast for us ) .
1000 bucks for one starter and a hookah so watch out how much you order here .
Had high hopes of visiting this place during my visit to Hyderabad , Tried reservations , however , no prompt response , the number seems to be switched off at times and if it connects no one picks up .
This made me think twice before going in to this place on a Saturday night and had to back off .
But looks can be very deceptive like they say .
And it holds true in this case .
This is a mixed bag... We found space on the Terrace and , well , the heat and humidity cannot be blamed on vapour but if you have a terrace capacity , you ' d expect some more fans .
Something I ordered in shrimps was not as great - the shrimps were frozen shrimps and not fresh .
Nothing stands out and I wish they ' d speed up their service time up on the terrace... .
There were a good number of free tables , and to this day I wonder why he lied to us .
However the khari could have been crispier .
I think this one could have used a lil more flavor .
Somehow it lacked the authentic flavors like the other dishes .
...The ambience reminds of d bakeries of Mumbai ....The entrance can be improved a bit as it is just besides HRC and it gives a feeling of backend of it .
This place is quite famous..but i personally didn ' t like it at all .
.They even cant give recommendations .
the area whr dey keep food should b properly cleand !
The bartender is a totally confused guy..he gives a repeat of ' first love ' with campari and argues for it .
The garlic bread was not toasted properly and the wedges had to be sent back for a better fry .
Overall lacks on the basics .
Overpriced for the quality it serves .
I had ordered duck though it was a disappointment to my expectation and they were courteous enough to change my order at no extra cost .
And since then the menu has mostly been stagnant except just a few handful new dishes that have been grudgingly introduced by the chef .
Though the rates of thr dishes are exuberant some of them are worth giving it a shot .
I wish they lit up the restaurant a bit .
Overall it is slightly expensive but we had a fantastic time would love to go there again .
We had Daab Chingri & amp ; it was a far cry .
I tried the shorshe ilish and they made it with powder shorshe !
It is one of the few places where ( i thought ) one could get authentic bangla dishes , and still it doesn ' t do justice to this fact.
2 of the 3 dishes were really good but as only 1 not - so - well prepared dish was enough to spoil the lunch .
must mention the kasha mangsha served there is no where wat we bings make .
The delivery took a long time even though my place was very near to the restaurant .
Maybe all deliveries here are like this .
The only problem with the Tiniali joint was the space .
They couldn ' t serve a good dahi puri.
Definitely not tasty enough for a second visit .
What the heck....
A not so good Hookah + mosquitoes .
Place is so crampy .
I would have given this domino ' s a higher rating but my experiences here stopped me to do so .
They ' ll take your order in the same time as a normal domino ' s takes to process two orders .
They won ' t refill the seasoning containers on the table frequently , so you ' d have to jump from one table to other in search of seasoning .
The seating is very congested .
dominossss... i dont knw wht has happened with them they used to be famous for cheesy burst but even u burst the pizza u ' ll not find the cheese... dudes pls dont do that .
.. dont spoil ur name in peoples mind specially who r foodie like us .
Domino ' s Pizza upto a few years back was very inventive and their pizza ' s were loaded with stuff .
Domino ' s is no longer a good choice .
The service can be improved though .
Food was served on time , but the taste wasn ' t great...
Ordering wings is as good as ordering some bones .
While I was waiting I got my hopes up for nothing , they served burned kebabs , and you just had to ask the server for everything .
They did not change the place Matt and no forks , spoon were at the table .
Oh yes the buffet , I was baffled people kept putting different spoons different dishes cause no other spoons were provided .
One waiter just kept the food on the table and ran away , would go back again but with caution
Yes , the door is little so please do work out and go : D , and it ' s slight on the expensive side , so do have a drink or two before you pay the bill : ) .
An overhyped place .
The concept attracted me to the place but it did not sit well with the overall atmosphere .
Amongst all that was on offer didnt like the taste of the minstrow soup .
..could have been better .
....however one thing the authorities should look into is the non functioning escalator thats reqd to be rode to reach the restaurant.....a trouble for the aged....hope dat gets sorted quickly .
And too loud for a nice conversation ( and not that the music is particularly good ) .
Personal party @ the M - floor : being away from the main floor service was a challenge , air con sucks..
Only Problem is With Food .
Ordered Veg Sizzler , Completely Off The Beat .
That ' s what happened with me .
My hunger went off as I waited for the ordered food .
Finally after a great deal of determination and daunting table reservation system on weekends of this not so professionally managed Restaurant , we got ourself a table .
Busy in the evenings maybe due to its inviting Decor or central Location this place , even after sitting down feels under - staffed because of the lack of attention and personalized service you get plus the reception is always crowded with people wishing you to skip a course and evacuate the table .
Can do a lot better if they focus on Quality more than Quantity , Service and Customer feedback .
However , we didn ' t experience anything worth recommending or mentioning .
With all the competition around with the food outlets , a little more flavoring with the food would help .
Seemed like the flavours didn ' t set in the meat .
This was not accepted from a hotel of the class of Marriott .
...at too high a price !
I later lost my appetite when I came to know it is a veg restaurant .
Seating took time .
We were ushered into a room upstairs which was musty .
.Wish grill was innovative but tastes was not that good .
Slightly higher than other club rates ( alcohol ) , but that must be the premium for the view .
Tend to charge minimum billing for tables - beware .
I was very excited to go for the first time but I wasn ' t very impressed .
Flip side : the restaurant turn into a club on week ends , the two bar counter are always crowded so getting a drink is kind of tough .
hardly any options for vegetarians and whatever lil is available is absolutely of no use !
But some of the staff is not at all courteous .
They r trying to hype up the place by showing off their attitude .
So , I prefer Skyye !
Could do much better .
Then the Thai veg curry was another disaster .
We couldn ' t eat .
I think only cows could eat that .
It was prepared out of coconut oil .
I can ' t suggest the place to anyone .
.. May be u can try another spot for our special moments .
Will not recommend it to anyone .
I would just suggest that the price could be cut down a bit because i find that for a pure veg restaurant , it is a bit too pricey for my liking .
The music was loud .
I ordered there grilled sandwich which was not upto my expectations .
I didn ' t find food value for money .
May be because of that I couldn ' t relate it to rock music .
this place is very famous..though i guess a bit over rated .
.. i did not like the seatng arrangement much .
Was excited ( not anymore ) to be at this place EXOTICA .
I don ' t think it doesn ' t take 20 minutes of time for any person to get one glass of soft drink .
Please review your vegetarian menu .
overall ...hilsa festival nothing great.
Ambience is not that impressive..
Firstly , the staff didn ' t let me occupy empty sofa seats which were empty throughout my stay at the place .
I told the staff repeatedly for a shift to the sofa seats but they kept telling us that they were reserved .
The pizza crust tasted like fried roti .
It got too smoky.. We had 2 starters and cocktails and left... As this place anyways doesn ' t have much for main course.. .
food n drinks on d pricier side .
Over hyped..
Mr Awinash his senior was atleast courteous and explained that they have a concept of talking advance books of 70 % of the tables and 30 % is walk in - this was clearly not communicated to us when we had tried to do advance bookings a couple if days back - on the contrary we were told no advance bookings are accepted .
My suggestion to the management is - have proper communication - have courteous staff manning the entry and bookings
Used to be good .
He food is sub - par .
I had ordered pasta ( penne in red sauce ) and it was flat .
I think the chef earlier ran away .
For the price that these guys charge the food should do the talking and not misty the ambience .
Would not recommend the place .
Idiots
Over rated .
The lasagne is also fine but not too good to be given a try .
But I ' d be lying if I didn ' t say that there is an element of hype to the legend .
Was quite meaty , good bun , felt there should have been more mix of cheese mayo and mustard which comes injected inside the patty .
Had there been lill more wetness with sauces and lettuce it would have been a different level .
However , the place has only one restroom which makes it a long wait time .
Had to wait for a table for quite some time on a Saturday afternoon but it was worth the wait .
The only problem I had with this place is maximum things finish up fast and they do not have enough service people to clean up the place
The staff i feel they really should educate em and maybe hire a few more people .
Of course , the unimpressive lighting and the constant din add to the chaos .
The custom request was fulfilled with a liquid which looked and tasted like a cross between lime juice and chaas .
Apart from the name nothing is good .
Though Atmosphere 6 publicizes itself as a place to have world cuisine , the menu is anything but .
On top of that , the wait staff do not have sufficient knowledge about what goes into a dish .
We were also taken aback by the menu card itself .
Coming to the food itself , it is anything but out of the world .
Last but not the least , if you looking for a quiet place to spend a romantic evening with a loved one , give this place a skip .
Every single time I ' ve called them I haven ' t been able to make a reservation .
Guess you guys are struck off my ever wanting to come to you list .
And mind it , this place is only for good tasty food and not ambience , so .
But if you are going there with your family or with your girlfriend please avoid it .
The seating weren ' t that comfortable .
So , they are slightly more expensive than what this portal tells you .
I have one complain though - they do not take bookings for days in advance .
This has been my 4th attempt to reserve a table for 2 , and have not been successful .
If asked to speak to the manager of the restaurant , never been available .
Non veg would be a gem to the menu .
Overhyped !
The khaosuey lacked the coconut flavour and was a bit oily .
You should check " busaba " for how they make their khao suey .
.. 4 of us in d sitting area and we had 10 people to serve and just stand around .
This restaurant is not elderly - friendly ( way too many steps to climb ) .
So , if you are thinking of a family lunch or dinner , you ' d better consider one of the other restaurants .
But then again , if it was a Pizza that I wanted , there sure are better places to go to than this one .
There were flies everywhere .
It took our complaining to get the waiters to run around the room with that electric fly swatter while we sat there covering the food .
But Foods Makes U Dissappoint !
Good Music , Bad Service , Not so great Food .
Firstly the music in the area where we were seated was too damn loud and considering there weren ' t any other guests we asked them to turn it down a tad .
Had to ask thrice for just this .
Next , the food came in batches and we were made to wait a long time before the next order arrived .
Better go to mainland china or barbeque nation in 26 sector .
They could have so much more crowd and people if they just time down the volume .
But what is up with the loud music... And it ' s not that Beatles or ACDC .
.. though beer is only kingfisher on tap.
hopefuly dis was our last visit to dis place .
Along with the feel , and the toys , the prices too are fancy .
Lotzz of Crowd In Weekend , Prices Too High .
I want my money back .
This day will haunt me forever .
The salad bar is costlier and the ambiance is likewise .
Now this place has lost its charm .
Do not go here !
A day later we were all puking !
Its a huge place and we sat outside as I thought music was too loud .
Very loud music...can barely hear your partner .
Indoor restaurant roof looks out of place and probably under maintenance .
..with too many service charges and taxes
Somehow I couldnt overpass the baked assorted vegetables .
Parking can be an issue # MG Road blues.
# reservation in advance is kind of mandatory for the balcony table .
There is no wide spread for lunch buffet .
I feel its lil over priced for the spread they have .
Except for a fact that we need to make plans in advance if we prefer to sit out in the open area !
Didn ' t expect this .
They have a number of exquisite dishes on their menu but both the dishes we ordered were quite bland .
They should just stand within earshot of diners and let them enjoy their privacy .
Time and again they would come to our table and ask us about food .
I don ' t recommend going to Park Prime .
Yes , when it was Park Plaza the service was good but now I don ' t recommend .
kindly work on your menuWell i have been going to all such places and one common thing I came across is that the service staff is too lazy I don ' t know the reason but until the place becomes crowded they move like ZOMBIES .
Though the service staff needs to be more attentive and customer focused .
Place should only be visited for the food and not for the service .
Do not visit during monsoon as there are a lot of insects during that time and the food doesn ' t seem very hygienic .
Only drawback is for those seating near the open kitchen as heat may disturb you .
But yes it was not upto the mark as expected at this kind of property .
So , in all I did not find the quality in accordance to the prices
Starters not that good .
There ' s a really nice vibe about the place , but it is disappointingly loud for a dinner place .
The roasted beets salad seemed to have boiled beets instead of roasted beets .
The lamb burger was moist but surprisingly was served without any condiments on it .
Overcooked steak smothered with way too much BBQ sauce .
Only problem being it was a huge portion , the 3 of us barely got through half .
Heavy on pocket : ) .
....... overhyped
No walk in guests are entertained .
Are you kidding me ?
It ' s just a gimmick to create hype .
It ' s just a gimmick to create hype .
And the high price to some extent .
I completely feel this place works on 2 things hype & amp ; PR .
Over hyped !
Luckily got a table , whilst others crib about their reservation policies .
Was willing to there to experience their food , on second thoughts , based on my experience on phone , i wouldnt even recommend the restaurant to anyone .
Coz i am a Hotelier myself and this is not the way guests should be handled , especially on phone .
Table booking in advance is highly recommended .
A bit high in price compared to the others but really great .
I didn ' t see the hype that reinforces Loyans .
Favorite of the fans of Butter chicken and kadhai chicken , either I don ' t like this kind of food , or this restaurant is way overhyped .
I would rather hop over to CP to grab something better ( atleast a better view ) .
To begin with , we weren ' t offered a menu for good 20 mins till I finally asked for it .
Also , personally I felt that the food was high in salt content .
Considering that it ' s a well settled chain , all such key aspects must be looked into .
The downside of this restaurant is that there is too much waiting time , but I find it all worth after finishing the meal..
This is one of the rare restaurants , where thr is waiting even on weekdays , that ' s what happened with us as well .
We finally got our table 30 min later .
The restaurant has done nothing to their decor to absorb the noise .
Come to this place if you absolutely sure you dont want Indian food
Though I was really excited to be here since the place really looked uber cool , and mind it really is very cool , the staff was a lil bit of a disappointing .
They didn ' t handle the food very well causing a lot of spillage on the table .
The environment was awesome , the food was not very awe inspiring or taste bud tingling .
Was looking to get more out of the experience .
Pretty small I will say .
It is right next to the station , so isn ' t really well placed .
...The Service here is the biggest weakness they have .
They did not give us time to enjoy our dinner .
Cream and water layers were different and bread crumbles were old and uneven .
cauliflower ) which did not go well with the sali mutton .
Except Berry Pulao nothing is good .
They can ' t even track an order , forget about delivery time .
The delivery boy was not keen to return the change and we had to ask for it .
I would like to suggest that people should prefer to go for Night Owl instead of Batman .
They took over 3 hours to deliver the food as the driver was " new and doesn ' t know the ways at all " .
Infact I found maal gaadi as a better option - bit more tastier and definitely reasonable priced
Indian vegetarian food is very oily and tastes just average .
After a couple of times i just decided to go hungry .
I don ' t think owners of this restaurant are concerned with food quality that much .
Taste wise it needs improvement .
Price is tad expensive keeping in mind you are having banana shake and maggi but ya almost justified with such a service at 2 am .
But heart wont b satisfied .. For me never ..
They can improve their quality ..
The prices are higher that what is displayed here .
The prices are higher that what is displayed here .
The only problem this place has is lack of proper arrangements for people to have their food .
I do not like their seekh kebabs as they are always deep fried here and not done on charcoals .
The sitting area can be a bit off .
Though the services were slow then compared to other Pizza Houses , but it ' s worth a wait !
The only disappointments are the garlic breads and service .
The staff has changed and so has the quality of food .
The staff looks lost .
We wanted some brocolli added to the pasta and when asked , the waiter didn ' t even know what brocolli is .
However , this never happened during my innumerable visits to BYD before .
.only time i felt the service wasnt good was when i filled the survey form n after that waited for the billing guy to punch my bill .
Being a veggie cant really talk about the more famous chicken dishes , but for all veggies out there , achari paneer and cheese naan is what you just cant avoid .
I booked place on phone but still it took 30 mins to get .
Every order took 45 mins .
Getting up to the restaurant is a task though .
They should definitely do something about it .
But as it turned out , the place is not that exciting afterall .
The food here is not that great .
I suggest you eat somewhere out and then go here .
They need more food options .
Idk why they have so much of attitude .
However if you are going to eat then it is not at recommended .
so probably one can conclude it ' s not a day place .
as regards the food , it ' s very ok.we called for a martini which was not what the menu stated.
there was evidence of basil at all .
again I guess it ' s just a place to party and for drinks , where obviously food quality wouldn ' t matter .
Should have had some more options in the food menu .
Cocktails could have been better .
Only two deserts were on the menu .
The bill doesn ' t come with the discounted amount , you have to explicitly ask for it .
I would suggest to visit this place for some beautiful occasions as the place is highly expensive .
Rude lounge was much much better .
over priced since its a 5 - star - like ambience , but a sure shot feel - good feeling .
I didn ' t find the food that appealing .
Many food items lack taste .
Also lack of variety in the menu .
Wouldn ' t suggest it to anyone .
( Good point ) Tip : If coffee improves a lil bit , it would be quite better .
The bruschetta , honey chilli potatoes and crisy fried corns were could .
Carrebian curry and pasta could be avoided .
Downside ; Hot beverages not as good .
Food taste must be improved.
And iced Tea was too strong and sweet .
.Every cuisine that the restaurant claims to have is not done any justice to .
After having visited the restaurant at least 7 - 8 times ( coz friends dragged me ) and after having tried so many different dishes I can say with confidence that the food overall is simply not impressive by any standard !
Add to that the super tiny food portions that will leave you feeling hungry even after having paid a hefty price that would get you and a buddy a dinner and maybe a drink at most comparable grade restaurants !
Improvement required on the service part as it is a bit sluggish .
dnt Ever visit replay....a disc without a DJ..is like a band Wala repeating same songs..and playing full songs ....and if you are visiting for having dinner..then it is good .
...and my car was about to .
Location is kinda crappy .
Could be a lot more attentive .
Service : Not that great .
They have their own parking area but parking might be a problem in rush hour .
Think about it , as these are the same people who would some day come to you in large groups but not when they are treated like this .
they dont have much variety in Indian recipes .
The seating is not much comfortable ; may be because of it is a food joint visited by a large of number of peoples .
6 people and has table tops for people who wanna enjoy a drink or two and just have fun .
So infrastructure isn ' t upto the mark and we had to talk a while to get our place sorted out .
food quantity is low ....
ok types not very good.
the only thing i did not like about the place was the live music .
the music was too loud and i could not even talk to my friends peacefully .
a bit expensive for the quantity they provide but it's good
though i was a little unhappy with the quantity rest everything about it was good .
grossly over priced .
the place is over priced and i was not at all happy with the quantity they provided .
also the taste wasn't up to my expectations .
i feel they are very fond of black pepper as each dish has a blend of black pepper & amp ; teriyaki chicken was blended with full of tomato sauce which made the dish very sweet ....
the food still has a lot of scope for improvement to match up the decor .
hence i suggest you call up and place an order as you are on your way to the restaurant .
wish they had more outlets in Mumbai !
couldn't even eat 3 pieces and felt like i was gonna puke .
for this price , there are so many other better restaurants than this restaurant in bangalore .
i feel that it doesn't worth your money at all .
we left the full dish untouched .
pricing is a bit steep ,
if you are going there on weekends may the luck be with you .
we waited more than half an hour to get a table for 3 .
music was too loud .
waiting time is a turn off
but always crouded .
but the waiting is what will kill u
thought u have to wait for 1 hour to eat in it , i also did it .....
i think its overrated .
food is Dhaba types and nothing is amazing .
go if you want to have Dhaba food
overhyped ..
in terms of quantity they serve pretty less .
food is ok , service cud b bettr n d music cud definitely b much bettr
all in all , nt a hearty meal ...
we had a 15 minute waiting time
the spread was nothing to talk about
but not all drinks are available .
these people forget that they need to serve or have a table to attend to .
but because the pricing is a quite steep have rated it a 4.5
but the menu lacks consistency .
but stay away from the the refreshmint !
nthng much available for vegetarians ...
the music is too loud
with our plates and water glasses there was no room to put the dishes we ordered .
we got no response when we requested to join the adjacent table .
but pulav was yet to come .
of reminder finally 30 minutes later we received pulav .
low on ambience ..
but i wish the tables were cleaner .
alimentos , the place has a very delusioned feel to it.
personally i feel if the interiors could be re done so that the eyes could be at ease.
but the host who took my order hadn't studied the menu well , there were some items on the menu that i discussed with him about which he had no clue.
but when your order comes there's no enough space on table to put order at table of four .
but the service needs improvements
totally crowded place and not even clean at all .
the taste of food could have been better if they would have kept same mumbaiya taste
also , reservations are highly recommended .
but , overpriced and it isn't the best food in town .
if i wanted to just unwind , hear the wind and the chimes ring while i read my book , i'd probably head here to blow my monthly budget for some just - about - alright food .
good for nothing place ..
unnecassary hyped ..
never to be meant fr inside sitting,
i hope the concerned authorities do make a note of this .
