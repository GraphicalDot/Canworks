Coming to the drinks n food - love their appletinis and honey citrus salads.
the menu is cyclic on weekly basis .
the wraps are great too !
The good thing was we enjoyed the meal and the drinks .
Everything was good , but thats what , it was good .
I would recommend it to non vegetarians and the reason is maybe I set the bar a little too high .
But for vegetarians its a strict no , cause if you dont remember what it tasted like than its not worth it .
While it was mostly what I expected , the flavour is not quite the same as what is served in other countries , but it ' s good enough ( loses half a point ) .
My order was one of their famous Peri peri chicken which i could see on most of the tables .
...Galouti Kabab is must have & amp ; as much as you can have .
Biryani is awesome but while having all this save space for desserts as they have wide varieties most of them good .
I had my First Drink Ever at Hard Rock Cafe - Saket Delhi and It was a sex on the Beach drink which was yummy .
Need to work on main course .
Hope less food .
I wasn ' t disappointed and felt that most of these burgers can be a part of the regular menu .
The menu had bland shrimp , oil soaked fish , and different variety of chicken at 8.4 ORNot worth the price .
We left the table without eating our desert .
the food was pretty awesome and the beer was cold to the right degrees .
It happened , i was feeling mesmerized by having " Dahi ke Kabab " and of course they were much much better than my previous experience .
If you like chicken , And only one place you could go in Delhi for Dinner , With friends , or with someone new to the city , or even aloneThis is it .
It was ok , not great and the price range was quite high for all the products .
For those who have any idea or taste of Mughlai Food , this restaurant is not a place to visit .
Coming to the food , the only real reason one goes out to eat , was certainly not up to the mark .
The bread was stale , the fries were soggy the meat cold and the prices high .
I did not enjoy my burger and was let down by the portions as well .
The food lacked energy and depth .
There were too many ingredients that over powered each other .
Whereas the double bacon cheddar was a little better than the Houston expect this place has more room for improvement .
The only thing that I liked were the shakes .
According to the menu , when it was first served in USA it was given a rating of 12 out of 10 .
.. Well having said that the biryani n the kebabs plus the breads can give karims a run for their money .
..Starters are good but not better than barbeque nation .
...Main course is limited and not good at all .
.. they provide you with four types of starters and all are soo good .
The food is good .
The food is good .
The kebabs are not as good as they are at Radisson .
For those who have any idea or taste of Mughlai Food , this restaurant is not a place to visit .
You will be making fool of yourself if you will visit the place with great expectation for Mughlai food .
These people are cheating on you in the name of Mughlai food .
!The worst Buffet Restaurant i have ever been to .
Please avoid such a quite and non - happening place with some of the worst options for vegetarians .
The Great Kabab Factory is the greatest place in Delhi for Indian food .
Should go atleast once to know how good can kababs be !
However the food was good like I expected .
Laal Maas : I am a die hard fan of this speciality from Rajasthan and and you get it best from my hands : - ) .Taste was good but mutton could be more tender and the gravy should be a little less tangy .
In Starter we ordered Makai Seekh and Burrah Akbari ( Kebab ) & amp ; Neza kebab .
Food is OK , service also not that great .
.. Well having said that the biryani n the kebabs plus the breads can give karims a run for their money .
Overall food was good .
Moist and flavorful .
I did see the bartender make at least 5 or 6 of some sort of mojito within 20 min so that must be one of their best - sellers .
..Peri Peri is good but other than that I didn ' t find anything good .
Awesome food !
Their chicken is just too good .
It was big , its taste was balanced .
Their menu is interesting and have many options for the non veg people .
I would just say that the burger was decent nothing great , but I would suggest don ' t try lemon & amp ; heb chicken because its close to be be being bland , it seems to have no chilly , salt nothing and no taste of lemon too !
!Thhe 1 / 4th chicken was good , ample for 1 person I should say and bearably spciy too .
I was told that there is this Portuguese lemonade that is awesome but was not there today .
I enjoyed the Food as much as my other friend enjoyed their peri peri chicken .
As it comes to food appertizer and belive me that really light a spark in me to go for lunch or dinner ASAP .
Heads off to the Chef .
!Not only was the food stale but the snacks were stinking as if served from preserved kitchen coolers and not freshly prepared .
Superb Food .
The food is just great .
These guys are out on a mission to knock you out with their starters which are mind blowing .
If you get to the main course , you will realize that the quality of food does not end at the starters .
They have a good menu for mocktails , cocktails and other alcoholic drinks .
We started with their mutton tikkas , the portion size was quite big and the tikkas were soft .
This is one of the main go - to places for rolls .
The best part however , was clearly the food .
Food : Their Sushi ' s are to die for .
Very average food .
Don ' t have liquor license as of now but said they l get one soon .
Like always the food was very good , can ' t be better .
I do not think many people know ( or that many care for it , but for those who do ) , that they even prepare their dal without onion and garlic .
I was expecting the food to be too delicious and finger licking , it was not as per the expectations .
The best thing was that they had this tradition to eat with hands .
The table next to me was occupied by some business crowed and i think they were some north east and they were literately licking there and taking pictures of the huge bread served to them .
The food without a doubt is good but not great .
I also like their bread basket though if you are going with a large group then you should order naan bukhara to share !
Yet the moment the food arrives you forget these inane thoughts and the flavors overtake you .
Maybe the Daal is overhyped...but it still is fantastic...maybe the menu is boring...all tandoori dry food only .
...but they are the best tandoori options in the city .
Heaven for every foodie ..... Superlyk food , superb ambience .... Must visit !
The best restaurant food I ' ve had in my life .
While the shimla mirch dish was good , the daal was no where close to the hype created about it .
Quite frankly , I had a better Daal at karnal haveli the same day .
Overall , I found the food okayish .
This place is full with so many food lovers , so my friends were right but it did not matter because the taste made up for everything .
Flutterflies & amp ; the Kaala Khatta Whisky were my favourites among all that we ordered !
But it ' s worth going even if you are a vegetarian .
If you love Chinese food , its a must .
Specially will try nasi goreng and soto ayam , its from my country .
The one thing that brings me to this place again and again is the Pad Thai they serve.it is one of the best you can find in delhi .
and i dont mind it either , great fine dine ambience.little load of steps to climb , but really good chinese food to eat.
Other items on the menu that I tried were the biryani and qorma and were average .
All the Mutton preparations are awesome and you just can not resist the temptation and craving after you see or even just get the aroma of it .
Ambience here is not of much importance because as soon as you will get your food you will forget everything except your meal and it is worth paying that much and enjoying .
I recommend this place to all those who enjoy good mutton preparations .
They practice on a number of Mughlai dishes & amp ; have excelled on few of them .
The Kakori version of Kebab is the throne among Alkauser ' s excellence & amp ; majority of Zomato review mentions them .
Also Galauti of chicken version was in our menu list & amp ; to my surprise the aroma & amp ; texture Alkauser created , was mind boggling !
Just keep in mind Chicken Galuti will not melt into your mouth & amp ; tends to be more chewy compared to their mutton counterpart .
Great job .
STREET FOOD at its BestI just love the way they cook their food .
.Very TenderVery JuicyVery SpicySuper Authentic Mughal FoodIt is so good that you need to try everything from their menu , which is not very elaborate .
I ordered a black forest cake from here , yes I know what you are thinking are there people who still have black forest cake .
Well my best friend loves black forest and every time we have a party at her place she insists that we only get a black forest cake and that is exactly what we do for her .
I also like to take some chocolate pastries and Angels in my Kitchen does a modernly good job with some and an excellent job with the others .
They have everything fresh , everything seems like a mini gourmet version of the old bakeries they have strewn around the city , some of those are quite disappointing .
With the right amount of sweetness , moist and soft along that a good attractive texture to go with , Angles in my kitchen adds up the list for craving my sweet tooth .
Except for their Death by Chocolate , I am quite unfazed by any other item they serve .
It ' s not that bad a patisserie but somehow the punch is always missing .
Well even during peak weekend hours , I still see their stuff full on display so either they would be replenishing the stock or never sell out .
I tried the chocolate shot today because it was a small thing to eat before heading for my dinner .
Eg : Rainbow Cake , chocolThere are however few options for people who prefer eggless food .
I have heard a lot about beef burger but being an Indian i avoid to have that .
They have a world cuisine menu and so many different varieties of food , one can really get confused .
Their collection of cocktails are amazing .
The food is out of the world & amp ; the desserts just heavenly , it cannot get better than this .
It wasn ' t too good , but not bad either , particularly if you consider that the buffet was priced at about rs.
The food is impeccable and leaves no room for complaints .
have been there twice... gr8 food .
Food is great.
Pls visit this place and be ready to wait
The side dishes and the salads do not provide the kind of joy that their chicken does .
however the food being the focus , our expectations were met .
Hated the food .
Not of my personal taste .
Great Food .
They have kept their marinate as it actually is in the other parts of the world .
Even those who do not have a penchant for spicy food should give it a try .
It was worth having .
It ' s awesome .
