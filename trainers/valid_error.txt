i had visited the radisson branch when it was quite newly opened and also remember meeting cricketer mohd azharuddin .they have a fixed menu priced costs around 1100 with taxes per person for non veg menu and around 950 for vegetarian .
even though nandos remain quite occupied everytime i go , there is no doubt about the flaw less service these guys offer !
They just stood there and watched the...read more
We had ordered a takeaway at your Cyberhub , Gurgaon outlet on Aug 17 evening ( check # 2093 ) .
.
.
.
..Within minutes of getting your table , after checking if you will opt for veg or non - veg , you are served hot and spicy varieties of barbecued chicken , lamb and fish.. Refills keep arriving on your plate till you are full and are compelled to say ' No ' .After that sumptious round of starters , you are served the main course - which is not so great - but the magical starters take care of that .
The place was well organised with nice pictures over the walls .
nice ambiance we ordered for one starter ( lagan ki chop ) and ghost biryani both were amazing , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , Service was prompt and food was delicious ...we will back again for sure .
Was a big name in South Delhi for its ever famous delicious roasted chicken and kebabs .
best burgers and malts......ill recommend route 66....and hersheys shake added malt.. .

Loved the decor and the ambience , ordered mini burgers , the chicken was good and the portioning was appropriate , however , they made me wait 25mins for my order .
The food was a li ' l above average if you have to wait for 25mins
..
.ambience was quite nice.. and the food was simply awesome... i must say its totally worth paying 499 + taxes per person .
The food is expensive but you should definitely try this place out if you haven ' t yet , you will keep going back that much I guarantee : )
Their Kebabs are pretty good , but lacks a lot in service .
.. : (
Galouti kebab is the speciality and is mouth watering.very courteous staff and excellent ambience.would recommend this place for all group parties .
....nice ambience.........but really expensive
The serve fantastic food and if you haven ' t eaten here yet then you are really missing out .
Pure white elegance & lt ; 3Excellent crockery with silverware : - ) Yummiest biryani I ever had : - * Will love to visit again : - )
Excellent food and very fast service , starters were very nice as well the main course can ' t comment about the deserts but if the ambience could have been better .

The mutton rogan josh was ok...the meat was tender , but the sauce tasted like tomato soup .
Which was ok tasting , but not what I wanted and expected .
It pains me to say , but while it ' s a decent place , but not at the top of Indian dining experiences .
..Peri Peri is good but other than that I didn ' t find anything good .
...
The sauces are not sooo spicy / hot and they are marketed , The chicken is great and tastes more yummy when it is served with love and courtesy .
I visited nandos many time when I went every time I feel goodNot comparable in taste ....Ambience niceService goodWanna to go againMust visit
!!!!
Neither too hot , nor too sweet .
... tried to catch up for dinner... and waiting line just put me off !

... we ordered for a Ceaser Salad , Garlic bread and Espetada Festival - a hanging wonder of the world !

This place is for the non vegetarians , s o my review is mostly based on my friends ' experiences and my own minus the food : / Non vegetarians - a huge assortment of foods , with some really quirky presentations : ) I personally love the Peri - Peri saucee and love them with all my foods - yes , you can buy those and take home .

Overall good food , definitely worth the prices .
Things started with a bang , then everything went downhill...one of my colleagues kept on and on about how great this place is , and I should definitely give it a look , so of me and my fiance went yesterday , we ordered the blue breeze , bloody mary and a margarita pizza , the drinks were fab , everything in the right proportion , but the pizza was just about average .
....We thought maybe pizza ' s aren ' t their forte , lets solider on and order something else , I specifically asked the waiter , what ' s your best , most popular veg starter and he replied , the veg seekh kebab , it came , we ate and it was just plain shite.....A BIG no no for veggie food , but apparently its great for non veg ( as recommended by my colleague , 666 lol ' s )
But If you wish to have a great time with you friends this place isn ' t suitable for you .
I have also tried their Paneer roll which is also tasty , and their Mutton Kakori roll which has a good flavour , but I found it quite oily .

..and nothing great there except the Daal anyway .
I bit too heavy on the pocket but 2 words - sikandari raan .
Reason 2 : People say it is over pricedReason 3 : People say the service is snootyReason 4 : People say that you never find a table unless you reserve in advanceReason 5 : People say that other than the dal bhukhara , the food is not that specialI wanted to explore for myself because I had more lovers than haters of this restaurant on my list of friends .
NIce ambience , courtageous staff but sitting comfort can be improved .
Service is good and speedy ... however I felt the food ( however well presented ) was not beyond the average taste of most of the joints in Delhi...All in all a very cool place to hangout with your buddies especially during evenings .... ( a welcome change from all the other enclosed , dark pubs )
The variety is excellent - - - - - 09 Mar , 2014 - - - - - Great ambience .
Complementary salad is nice.the place has very less noise as the crowd is good
While the non - vegetarians were all praise for the food , other vegetarians and I found the preparation average ; portions were generous .
they have an authentic chinese taste to the food , its different and yes its working well for them , staff very courteous and makes u feel at home .
So all comes down to is it better , but compared to whatFor Chines food this is place is nothing special , Average food nothing much to excite my pallet the only thing you would like is the fortune cookieMust avoid if your looking for chines food
This place offers no frill mediocre dining experience but with just...read more

But enough for you to make at least 6 - 8 visits before you exhaust their menuBit on the Expensive Side for a street food joint , but then they guarantee that you have the same flavor everytime you visit themThere is " ZERO " ambiance as like most of our street food joints , lots of bones , lots of dogsLots of Dirt .
The fish i tried was garlic fish that turned out to be stale , however the prawns made up for it .
The verdict : - Food / Taste - 7 / 10Service - 7 / 10Value for Money - 8 / 10Quality - 7 / 10Ambiance - 9 / 10Will be trying more passtries and cake soon !
These cookies are my favourite pick , i can have them packed and can warm it and eat them , but quite high on price for a 100 gm cookies you get around 5 - 6 pieces , cannot afford on every visit i pay here .
Except for their Death by Chocolate , I am quite unfazed by any other item they serve .

The pasta salad , basa fish ( I loved that ) , chicken soup , chicken stroganoff stole the crown..while the not so goods were the baby corn , red pasta etc .
The music is loud and with packed up weekends , it becomes difficult to catch the waiter ' s attention however the staff is well informed .
!Decent foodDecent crowdDecent place - one will easily fall asleep ; )
I have had better cooked and flavourful chicken in other outlets ( outside india ) .Bottom line : will I go again , may be notWill I recommend , may be once in awhile if you crave for it only then .
