This place is just PERFECT for all the Kabab lovers !
!The decor , service , quality of the food is amazing .
the great kebab factory is a great place to spend the evening in a group .
Often when you have heard a lot about a place , ur expectations are really high .
I am rating it a 3.5 because of the very average experience we had .
Being a fan of Nando ' s before it opened here , I deemed it essential to make a trip there at the soonest .
We had ordered a takeaway at your Cyberhub , Gurgaon outlet on Aug 17 evening ( check # 2093 ) .
After a night of partyin we woke up looking for breakfast close by at 4pm .
We decided to check out nazeers and were slightly disappointed by the menu .
Sets a very bad example .
Please clarify your stand .
I would like to give another try to nando ' s... although liked the chicken but still couldn ' t enjoy the way I thought ... but yes in taste it was good .
A restaurant that produces and serves kababs and tikkas by the kilo .
does justice to the name of the great kabab factory in gurgaon , even though i would still prefer radisson but this is also a good option to dine .
I ' d been to the GKF at Radisson , Pune and the experience was not good , but comparatively had a nice time here .
We visited this place for dinner last month on a Sunday with some friends .
Though not a great kebabs fan , yet this place took me by surprise & amp ; I enjoyed every moment of it .
Right from the food , to the ambience , to the paan , every thing seemed perfect .
In spite of the above , we plan to take friends over next week & amp ; hope not to be dissapointed .
They don ' t have a lavish menu but what they serve is pretty good .
good food , good service , staff is good but pricy.that ' s y 4 stars else 5 stars
Good food , good service - complete value for money
We left the table without eating our desert .
One of the Must Visit Places for a Good time with Friends .
: - ) If possible , plan for a weekday lunch / dinner .
alright......good food must visit............................... agaiiiinnnn
How can I not rate this place ?
It will be forever ingrained in my memory .
Okay aside from that , Hard Rock Cafe was pretty good .
It had fun music playing over the speakers , good food and a friendly waitstaff .
It held all the splendor of a time and I would definitely go back .
I have been a customer to them since their old days , when this joint was actually a dhaba across the nearby red light .
I would recommend you to go to Nando ' sTheir staff is friendly and supportive give you the best suggestions to order with correct information whether its taste or quantity .
I think it is basking on old days glory and the name it has earned after being operational for so long in that area .
Like most chains that come to India this too is disappointing .
Wouldn ' t go back there or recommend it to anyone .
Try it once , for the heck of it .
Okay so the newly opened American diner - Johnny Rockets didn ' t really touch my happy spot .
Well for a meat lover n a fan of mughal style of cooking with no fuss involved unlike a fine dine .
This place is a paradise.....
The place is nice , decently priced n the person on the counter is very polite ..
I ' ll surely be back soon .
.. Well having said that the biryani n the kebabs plus the breads can give karims a run for their money .
I went to The great kabab factory and it was worth travelling far .
..in short the place is worthy .
But the place and the food is OVER - RATED .
..was expecting much more from the place .
.. all togethergood ambiancegood foodgood servicehigh pricenot 100 % value for money .
there are better places .
Better visit Karims at Nizamuddin ( Nizamuddin only ) for a great and authentic taste of Mughlai food .
.....in an all it was a bad experience .
Try BarBeQue Nation , the food is much better and gives you better value for money .
Overall , a very BAD exprnc.
No Complimentary Beverage : ( I think Barbecue Nation is a better option : )
We visited this place last friday and that is one of the biggest mistake in terms of choosing the right place .
We wasted good amount of money and time there and end up with dissatisfaction oozing to our brim .
Just one word " wow " .
It used to be one of my favorite places of all times .
It ' s disappointing .
Pull up your socks !
Great place , great food and great hospitality !
Highly recommended place .
Total value for money .
This was one of the best ever dining experience I have had .
Definitely a must try .
Went with two of my friends as one of my friend told me this was nice restaurant and food was nice as well it ' s the name which is very old and famous .
I would give 4 / 5 as per the experience I had .
The place is nice , decently priced n the person on the counter is very polite ..
I mean real mughal style ...nazeers is the place .
But very well managed .
It was a pathetic experience .
Good food , ample serving size , good ambience...excellent service .
Just your average restaurant !
Nothing to worry when you are in Pure Punjab.....Perfect place by Lazeez Affaire !
Absolutely superb !
From ambience to servive and THE FOOD !
Super impressed with this place .
Oh this is just fine .
No razzmatazz no glitterati .
It pains me to say , but while it ' s a decent place , but not at the top of Indian dining experiences .
Went to Nando ' s as a group of 4.
Great service great food .
Ambiance , staff , everything was very nice .
Overall , 4.5 stars from my side .
... Guys ill be visiting again and again and again !
Going earlier works best - the place usually has long queues and runs mostly full both times of the day / night .
My rating would have been a big - ve if the option existed on Zomato .
Needless to say I was extremely upset throughout my visit to Nando ' s outlet at Cyber Hub .
No apologies tendered .
So I really wonder what is the hype around Nando ' s all about .
IMHO its very average food and even worse service .
Now this place is huge being in the Cyber Hub , with ample of options available .
The restaurant has huge seating area inside and a few chairs outside and still is almost always full .
Overall I just wanted to try it once but noithing spectacular that I would want to go back to .
My 3rd visit to Nandos , and I ' m saying , so what ' s all the fuss about !
May not be runnin , g back , despite the loyalty cards they are giving out now .
Enjoy
We have been long term loyal customers of Nandos from the UK and found it as good !
This one has potential to be great of they keep up the standard that they have set out to achieve .
Really nice place to hang out with friends .
The place has alot of good restaurants but i finally decided to go with Nando ' s. The place is huge and the seating is nice and comfortable .
Poor................................... , , , , , , , ,
Awesome PerI Peri chicken and very humble and active staff .
Very nice place .
Good place to hangout with friends .
Nice place to be with friends .
I had heard alot about this place and decided to finally visit NANDO ' s located at the DLF CyberHUb Gurgaon .
Maybe I had very high expectation from this place but there was no wow factor at all .
What can I say , the place is just amazing .
Went there for lunch after a long time and came out wondering why I dont go there more often .
I am not a non veg eater , still went to Nandos with some of friends who just cannot resist non veg .
In - fact whole bunch of us ( some of whom were veg ) liked the food and the service so much that it has become our preferred choice over some veg restaurant .
Hope they keep up with the quality of food and service .
Have already made 4 visits so far and will continue doing so .
Nandos in Jo ' burg is a regular joint and they have beer as well .
The Bangalore outlet was at par .
The Inorbit Mumbai was below par .
This new outlet is really fantastic and up there .
Hope they keep up with the quality of food and service .
Have been a fan for almost 6 years now .
Surely coming soon for dinner .
Its really nice to visit you .
And the management Kindly plss maintain everything as it is at present .
had heard a lot and went with expectation to have a gala time but was really disappointed with the approach of the service staff , quality of food and even the drinks being served !
!Would never recommend this place to anyone !
I finally came across Light house 13.. which fit in all my arenas..
One of the best and my favorate place to hang out .
Thumbs up for Lighthouse13 !
visited with friends on a sunday and found the music to be extremely loud and it gave all of us a headache.the sofas were shaking with the boom of the music and the interiors were dingy and so dark that we couldn ' t see each other ' s faces.complaints about both weren ' t paid any heed to .
though the food was alright , the service was slow.we left with pounding headaches from the music and sore throats from having to shout to make conversation .
Very nice place to bring a bunch of employees from work and let them run wild .
They are ' different ' and I did not have to pay for ' different ' because they gave us a package to include almost everything cept the parking .
Everytime I enjoyed alot , specially while sitting at terrace .
Advantages of the place : - Place is cozy .
Khan Chacha is one of the really good Mughlai joints in Delhi and it is one of my favourites .
Its simplicity is what we loved best .
I hope they try to maintain good quality ingredients , specially owing to how they price the rolls decently high .
I ' d heard great things about this restaurant and i have to say it definitely lived up to my expectations !
I feel like i will keep returning to this place to try all the options on the menu !
Town Hall happens to be one of the most spectacular restaurants I ' ve visited in the recent past .
The place will be buzzing once the liquor license is available .
Awesome ambiance , good music , loud enough for our ears n low enough to talk ( without shouting ) And food also meets expectation...all in all good experience .
...a big thumbs up
The space and crowd remains the best part
Visited this place for lunch today and must say the restaurant had quite a refreshing new feel to it .
One of the best concepts for a cafe place .
Definitely a recommended place to visit for great sushi and world cuisine .
.. was welcomed warmly by the hostess who helped me to locate my friends in this large and well done venue... and then it begins .
Second visit here , excellent foot specially the clay oven pizzas are too good , terrace sitting is the best and well done , menu is pretty big and good have something for very taste bud , service staff can be improved , overall experience has been grat
I thought the atmosphere and food were altogether fantastic .
I am completely in love with this brilliant place !
Its not your regular run - of - the - mill cafes providing fancy dishes !
They have a small box where you pay for your coffee / tea or for attending the event in whatever amount u like ( no minimums ) .
I have got in contact with such great minds and made such amazing friends through .
The answer is an emphatic YES !
What I found was more than my expectation .
This is my favourite restaurant .
Excellent food , excellent service and excellent ambience .
Would give them 5.0 for all .
But as I see it , it is more about the experience of visiting the place and dining their than the food itself .
The way they give an apron to cover oneself , the way their kitchen is designed with a glass wall , all adds to the experience and the fun of it .
However , one thing that I would like to object to is their new policy of not allowing children before 10 : 00 PM for dinner .
...The Dalk BukharaNon veg starters platter... Tandoori stuffed aloo.... Puduna parantha....Phirni....Oh... My appetite is back writing this review.....The service is excellent....The only thing not positive I can mention about them is the wait for table despite tables being available..Although the positives and atrength of thia legendary place can be the each item mentioned on their menu....!
!A monumental and must visit in Delhi..!!
Over all experience was not that bad but it was not as per my expectation .
This place is very popular and well known .
I for one think that there are better options on the city .
To say the truth we all felt a bit cheated after leaving the place ,
Being a member of the ITc group when one visits bukhara there are huge expectations in mind and the restaurant definitely stands on those expectations .
..and nothing great there except the Daal anyway .
These are my thoughts before I enter Bukhara everytime .
There is a reason Bukhara has stood the test of time .
..yes it is all part of the never changing decor and helps increase turnaround...but its time to give your diners a little comfort .
Heaven for every foodie ..... Superlyk food , superb ambience .... Must visit !
This place has never dissapointed and has made india proud .
It was listed in the top 50 restaurants of the world by 5 different food and lifestyle magazines .
Could not find anything lacking .
Had a perfect evening dinner with my family .
this is one of the most epic places ive been to .
surreal and awesome !
No complaints with respect to food or service .
Bad..!!
And look after their customers rather than just making business
Awsum blossom !
No words to say !
Best North Indian FoodDal Makhani And Paneer is very tasty and it is in Delhi so not far at allA place everyone should visitLove the food hereHad an awesome time
Turned out to be the most distasteful experience !
Such a bad experience never again .
I was resisting going to Bukhara - ITC Maurya for so many reasons .
Reason 1 : People say it is overrated .
Full marks to this restaurant.http : / / peeyooshkaushikphotography.blogspot.in /
Well , there is a reason why everyone seems to be crazy about this place !
What a place .
Seriously what a place !
From the lovely location .
It just turned out to be a very creative place for me .
It ' s a perfect place for a quiet evening .
First time dine here n we r so happy n please .
All of them in perfect balance .
Will coming more now .
Not Recommended at all
Just 3 words 4 this place - Crap , crap , crapFood is completely pathetic.i wouldn ' t even breakup the rating coz i am confused about the worst thing about this restaurant .
A good place to hang out , well priced but limited options for vegetarians compared to some other Oriental restaurants in the city .
Its a must tryHighly recommended .
this place is my wife ' s favorite , so whenever we go khan mkt , she gotta eat there .
and i dont mind it either , great fine dine ambience.little load of steps to climb , but really good chinese food to eat.
Sidewok is a nice experience altogether .
The entry is well - lit and easily accessible , and there no is problem in finding the restaurant as there ' s a big board announcing it at the start of middle lane .
This outlet was much better than its CP outlet .
Great work .
Every time I visit delhi , I make it a point to visit this place .
Overall an amazing place for a great mughlai dinner .
You know at first glance that this is not a place for a " food snob " but a haven for true blue foodie .
Great job .
The Place doesnt seem to catch your fancy much , as its a Plain Eat at Roadside & amp ; Takeaway kind of a Place .
A family favourite .
The place is renovated and is pretty decent for having snacks and drinks !
Till the 1990s when the number of top class , high - end restaurants serving good Chinese food in Delhi was relatively low , Golden Dragon was considered a classy upscale restaurant where families like mine used to go on special occasions .
During lunch hours the place has turned into a watering hole for people working in offices in Hauz Khas .
This place is highly recommended .
The store is nothing more than a fairy tale and all items are so neatly placed .
My favourite bakery in cyber hub has to be Angels in my Kitchen .
On and on a good bakery in a good cozy ambience serving in the corner of cyber hub joints .
The Angels in their kitchen seem to be snoozing or on vacation for sometime !
Come on guys ; you can do a lot better .
I really liked the place .
Strikers is one of those rare places in Delhi where you can always have fun whether it is a weekday or a weekend .
.But overall worth it for sure .
Striker is one of the most known Pub in Delhi & amp ; Gurgaon .
I am very frequent visitor of striker ' s. This one is situated in VK , Delhi.
They have happy hours wherein they offer buy one get one on IMFL..The DJ at this place is one of the best DJ ' s found in a Pub..
Aa joint for lovers or a beautiful hangout place .
Just on the road a Mega Structure wid three malls and two luxury hotels is like a diamond in the golden ring .
Hard Rock famous for its hard rock music , ambience , food and a very different type of staff service .
I was impressed .
Awesome ambience , music , service and food .
Geoffrey ' s has always been my favorite place to dine at .
A must try indeed !
My expectations were much higher .
Felt like they were doing a favour serving food .
I ' d say , if you had to take your office colleagues or your ' serious ' uncle along , I would recommend this place .
Decent one !
I had come down here a few days back and I really loved it .
I now have new pub to chill out at on Saturday night .
: D - - - - - 29 Sep , 2012 - - - - - One of the best pubs I have been to in a long time .
Everyone loves this place !
First things first , how about considering your name changed to JOFFREY ( the most hated character in Game of Thrones ) as both of you work hard to make people annoyed of you .
Cool place , cool staff , nice food .
Pros - Good food , Good service , Good ambience .
To be honest I had high expectations from Nandos after having Nandos in other parts of world .
Trust me this place does fill up quick !
Others - 2.0Ambience - 3.0Service - 3.0Value for Money - 3.5Overall - 3.
Amazing place .
This is the place to be .
Excellent food , value for money .
Made it a point to have nando ' s on every subsequent visit .
Now i was a very happy soul when i got to know they have opened in gurgaon .
The best Coffee Shake in town ( or should I just say the world ) ... Great decor , great food
.not great .
All in all a good place to hangout .
And a wonderful experience all together for a disabled person .
Take my advice ; visit the place once in a month so that you don ' t get bored .
Itz good
I didnt liked this kfc much
Thumps up from my side .
The food , service , taste everything was horrible .
Maybe that should give you an idea how bad a place can be .
What a disaster .
Overall an horrible experience .
Please refrain even if this is the only option for food .
Overall : good place to go but should be really hungry to try everything
Awesome place for a corporate outing..
.would highly recommend to those who love to EAT DRINK AND TALK at the same time .
..Would love to visit again very soon .
The over hyped place in village dese days .
V ol happily enter .
But then upon entering also , we are asked to wait for another 5 min so that the people sitting before us can pay their bill .
Overall my rating - 2.5 / 5Keep socialising ppl !
A perfect place to spend your evening .
Suggestion : take a stroll before selecting a seat .
A nice place .
Recommended for once .
