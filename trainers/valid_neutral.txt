The most horrible thing to hear was " You are not the only customer we deliver , we have other people too "
!
.
like everything.. be it starters or main course..keep it up
.
.
I ordered aloo posto , ilish paturi , jhingri malai curry and steamed rice .
It tasted like zeera aloo .
Visited the place for a friend ' s birthday bash .
Overall my rating - 2.5 / 5Keep socialising ppl !
I would say it has a strong ambiance...
Birthday the best day of my life .
Chicken Biriyani : Never tasted biriyani like that , won ' t say i loved it and wont say that i hated it eitherSheermal : Heaviest Roti i ever had .
Went on friday late evening , was crowed as expected .
Brain curry got over , ordered mutton nihari , chicken stew , mutton korma and chicken jhanagiri .
Only nihari and korma was ok .
I ' ve visited once here .
Karim ' s is very famous among foodies for its quality of food but believe me I don ' t like their service and ambience .
I would recommend this only for the taste but not for the good time .
The gentry is always very much mixed .
Went at 12 midnight .
And couldn ' t believe it was full of crowd .
Went at 12 midnight .
And couldn ' t believe it was full of crowd .
When I took the first bite I could get the taste was different .
This was one lunch I will not forget for a long time .
I tried dosa on one occasion and a mini thali in another .
Reach before 1 pm to avoid queues at lunch time .
I wish they add more authentic south Indian veggies and curries to their thali .
Try it here .
They gave us a table on the second floor .
Sarvana bhawan is located just opposite to mybar in cp in p block .
We ordered a rava onion masala dosa and a regular masala dosa .
Tried idli and dosa by far .
I have been to naivedyam and sagar ratna before .
One reason being that they usually have a long line of people waiting outside .
Ambiance - The interiors of an average family restaurant with classical South Indian music playing in the background .
.. N if u already are a south indian food fan , then after being here .
..but den i hear it is a famous place .
..cannot comment .
.different people have different taste.. .
Talking about the ambiance , as the name says it is a blue themed restaurant with white furniture around .
Damn hope it is !
On a fine afternoon , me and colleagues were off with hectic schedule and thought to cool off with some good food : - ) Searched nearby places on Zomato and selected Pirates of Grill to be the place .
Chicken varieties and t masala used to prepare iit !
....Tomato Soup , Sweet corn soup , Orange Juice , Big 5 , Memory Buster , Shawarma - Paneer Xcelator , Roll - Nitro Hara bhara , Pizza : Italian & amp ; BBQ , Pasta Primevera , North Indian SabJi : Paneer Makhani & amp ; Butter Roti......and they Have dessert Carrot cake with Almond Sauce .
Seeing the high rating like 4.4 on zomato , I and my fried went to this place with very high expectations .
We ordered banana milkshake , cold coffee , pesto pasta basilico , paneer mushroom shawarma , Authentic Barbeque Pizza .
It was basically pita bread rolls with hummus , roasted potatoes , capsicum and many other vegetables .
We also tried this drink that had strawberry , apple , and a lot of lemon juice .
The service , food , value for money , ambience .
Went to Kaidi Kitchen to have veg continental food with a friend .
We ordered Fondue and it was a delight initially , although I found the quantity to be a little on the lower side .
When we arrived they gave us a area which has been designed as a jail cell .
I usually stick to eating Kebabs , Dal and Roti ' s whenever I visit .
On the improvement side , I would like to see them include Non - Vegetarian dishes , and more variety on the alcohol drinks front .
Nothing special about it .
I tried here red sauce pasta , veg pizza and veg spring roll .
Time wont affect your visit much , as the interiors are quite dark , dim lights .
Food quality is also okay .
Service is also okay .
As its a restro - bar i wont recommend you to go to this place for a date .
However , the dum biriyani and the mutton dish ( some rajasthani mutton curry - all red ) could have been better .
We ordered a battery of kebabs ( murgh malai tikka , paneer tikka - the ones I remember ) , bruschettas and Biryanis for main course .
We sat in the al fresco area in a cart .
Mostly lebanese and european .
Very ok food .
We ordered garlic bread with cheese it was average .
So my best bet would be to order at home !
Never really had too much of the main course as the primary purpose of going here is always to gorge on dumplings .
The turnip cakes are okay .
We had banjara chicken , fish fingers , white sauce pasta and crispy corn chicken .
Everything was real good but fish fingers can be improved .
We reached there early so were out early as well .
The right time to hit the place is 11 pm on weekends .
Sheesha nd liqour is also served here .
.. spacious
Here ' s what I tried here : Starters : 1.
Its just ketchup .
Food tasted good not that of expected .
We always start with the Yin - Yang soup accompanied by a Sushi platter .
We always start with the Yin - Yang soup accompanied by a Sushi platter .
We ordered Nasi Goreng , Bamboo fried rice one lamb side dish , one chicken side dish .
Service needs to be improved a bit .
Dessert - A cold choco cake with icecream .
As soon as you enter the ambience would make you feel that its going to be a nice experience .
The main course is okay .
The starters are the only thing that tastes better than any other thing on the buffet .
Desserts are also fine but not that great .
The food was a mixed bag .
Something I ordered in shrimps was not as great - the shrimps were frozen shrimps and not fresh .
I have tried vada pav from many places in Pune , so was looking forward to try this one .
The first bite of any vada pav can tell you about its quality .
Mushroom with Khari : Delicately sauteed mushrooms served on a khari or puff .
The mushrooms were done in butter and cheese .
It is a parsi drink made from fresh raspberries.
Aloo Aunty ' s Vegetable Cutlis : Such unique name !
Tardeos AC Market Mamaji ' s grilled sandwich : the recreation of famous mamaji ' s sandwich available in Tardeo AC market in South Mumbai .
It had spiced potato along cheese and namkeen sprinkled over .
They serve it with pav .
I started with Vada Pav which was a pair of bread with a Aloo Bonda in between .
For Food , we ordered Quattro Pizza , alongside vegetable Platter and Mexican Chicken .
Later we ordered Mint Sheesha , along with some Drinks .
Food is just okay , nothing exceptional .
Slow cooked lamb with jus and assorted veggies .
We ordered hookah and cheese balls and chilly chicken !
It could be better !
The quality of food was OK but it was nothing significant to write about .
A must visit for a fan of Bengali cuisine - that ' s what I thought after seeing the menu .
Ambience etc are ancillary .
Food is what matters .
Me and my friend went for lunch at there Beltola outlet .
We were really hungry and ordered for " Muri Ghonto " " Beshand die begun bhaja " and " golmorich die Chicke " .
Also would love to try other dishes they have next time like luchi and all .
I ordered for home delivery , one Chicken kosha with luchi and chutney & amp ; one Chingri Biryani .
Maybe all deliveries here are like this .
: ( Ordered bhaji pav and rava dosa .
Bith were okay but not delicious .
Had been there a couple weeks .
You get HOOKAH with n number of varieties .
So i had a Hookah for the first time with Mint Base .
Not bad but nothing to rave about .
It was just fine .
Nothing tasted extraordinary...
The taste of food is average 40 % not to expected level .
Went to this place for a quick drink last night which was a Monday .
.m goin wid a generous 3 / 5 for dis place , good but not enough.
This is a roof - top ( open - Air ) Bar - cum - Restaurant .
Where the starters and main course was okayish , the dessert totally killed it for me .
ok food , ok place , ok staff , ok deco , just ok !
!seriously.....just ok .
Visited last night for family dinner .
Food is average .
The food is but can be made better .
As some correctly say , over a cup of coffee lots of things happen !
That ' s what happened with me .
Basically its main theme is rustic look .
No wonder whenever u enter this place , it ' s all wooden .
: ) Order : I ordered a Cappucino .
.. .
My friends and I went for a brunch .
We ordered some mocktails and an Ice tea .
Desserts made it all up .
We were a party of 9 people , ordered Lucknawi Paraath Paneer , Challi Subz ki Seekh kebab and Murgh soola kebab for Starters along with rose , khus and Blue curaco coolers .
For the main course we ordered Badami Benarsi Kofta , Tarkari Masaledar , Pateeley Waale Choley and Dum Ke Kali Dal along with Jeera peas Pulao with an assortment of breads .
The main course was nothing Exceptional except for the fancy names to tickle your foodie imagination , the breads were rather disappointing especially the Chur Chur Naan but the Paneer Lifafa Parantha was delightful.
However , once we ordered a dish by the menu but it was not upto the mark so we sent it back to the kitchen .
The chef came out to speak to us and finally accepted that they had used some other cheese than the one mentioned .
Based on that , i do rue on missing out the chance to have a proper meal in this restaurant .
I went to the one in jubilee hills , we were a group of 6. we ordered a 2 pizzas and 2 pastas and also a couple of drinks .
We ordered am ultra lite kf , a long island iced tea and a white wine .
Would have rated 5 if it had non veg and wine .
Table reservation is must .
A very nice place but i found it a bit expensive .
Me and a friend of mine had been planning to try this place for a long time now and we eventually made it there .
.desserts were just okay .
I ordered the white sauce pasta !
Dont go with high expectations to high .
It is a nice place but you barely feel you are on the 32nd floor .
I wish they had more choice in food though I ordered nachos and they came in such a big heap that by the time we came to the end it was soggy .
Tried scallops with pickled plum , spicy cilantro chicken , tom goong , maguro nigiri and fish with garlic oyester sauce .
Only thing good about high is lounge is on 31 st floor and ambiance food is okay types not that great for the price quantity is very bad .. ?
Food .
Ambience .
We ordered asparagus wasabi .
I tried buffet here .
Ask your waiter for best combinations .
... Good for vegetarians ?
We ate Hickory BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger as well as Fritto Misto , I don ' t remember name of the dishes .
However the experience was neutral .
Drinks were good and we enjoyed it but food was not that great .
The ambience has nothing great to offer .
Thus , landed for dinner and the wait time to get a table wasn ' t quite long .
Can try it out once .
.Been visiting pandara road since i was a kid.. ?
But not on pocket friendly side as Lil expensive side but Worth it .
I am sorry but I am not one of the many that is enamoured of Chutney Chang .
Had been here for a team lunch , nothing great to write about .
Once for lunch and once for dinner .
For lunch we were given a place in the rooftop as place was not available inside .
They also organize buffet regularly in our company .
A la carte is way better , the buffet needs to improve a lot .
When our appetisers were served , I happened to mention to my husband that I couldn ' t taste the salmon in my sushi and suddenly a plate of salmon strips arrives .
If you are looking for a table on saturday night and a happening place .
I am pretty sure once they start serving their brewed beer , places like TOIT and all will be given a run for their money .
So you can understand the feeling !
Nothing much to say about the ambience etc .
..Nothing great .
The person on the phone responded that it is walk in culture and no bookings are accepted on the phone .
All they had to do was nail down some carefully selected and prepared appetizers and they were off to the races .
I went there with my family n would like to tell u guys about their service this time .
We visited this restaurant on a Saturday eve with our friends .
The place is so crowded that you may feel as if people have gathered for a mass ( especially in evening ) .
So he brought Country Feast Pizza , Home Made Ravioli Pasta & amp ; Lasagne .
But I ' d be lying if I didn ' t say that there is an element of hype to the legend .
Crowded place .
!Beef being my favorite went in for the Jamjar Juicy beef burger .
Though i wont rate it too high , its a place best visiting for all .
The music .
The food was OK .
The portion sizes are decent but the taste is just about average .
.. Burmese food !
I guess they have two different sections one for food and the other for liquor and sheesha .
Mugshot is inside jewel square mall which is still not renovated completely .
Expect an aveage drink to cost Rs300 and appetizers ( they don ; t serve anything else yet ) Rs350 .
Since it si closed , Mugshot is a little too loud at times , but choosing the right place can ease out that problem .
Finally our khao suey arrives .
If i have to sum it up it was an average experiance for me .
I haven ' t tried their buffet , so can ' t comment on that .
It was a veggie season and the offering here are limited .
Ordered the onion rings n garlic bread mezze platter .
Fresh crispy ( slight oily ) onion rings .
Rs.700 on the pocket .
Average .
They serve alcohol too .
We ordered a Paprika Chicken , a Mozzarella Pizza , a Chicken Calabrese , and a Fettucini Carbonara .
The Paprika Chicken was mildly - seasoned and tasted okayish .
Dominos Vaishali !
I hadd Chinese .
And paneer tikka .
They have a disco & amp ; a diner right behindSo entered to have dinner first .
Staff was average .
Ambience is average types .
The chicken makhani was not up to the mark but was good .
It was Saturday evening and we.
Took buffet .
Dress code !
We were given the menu for the day , which is very difficult to remember .
We ordered Nachos , Garlic Breads , White Sause Pasta ( Penne ) , Margaretta Pizza and Cheese Balls .
Bill : 2500 with tax .
Specially chinese .
Veg as well as non veg .
But beyond this , the place is just above average .
I would rate the service of this restaurant way below the 5 star standards .
This is just the place .
However as for rest of the menu..
though we generally enjoy beers but that day we went for cocktail and as usual it was difficult for me to choose and finally I said bring your best .
The food and the snacks are very limited for the vegetarian lovers..we tried corn seekh kababs and they were just okay..i have also tried the main course but that too is average in comparison to the rates it offer .
Ok food .
My parents being vegetarian ordered the vegetarian set menu - in which there were 2 options for the main course so dad got one and mum the other ( and I ordered the non vegetarian one ; so we basically had a try of all of the different items they have to offer .
( And yes , make that reservation )
Wasn ' t that grt experience for me .
The ghewar cheesecake .
Nothing gr8 !
The food has a few gastronomic things , but that ' s about it .
The dishes are plane jane , right from the starters to the desserts we did not find anything that was overly amazing , this kind of food can be found anywhere in Mumbai to be very honest .
The mocktails weren ' t that extraordinary either .
We finished it off with some paan flavoured cotton candy .
The ambience is pretty normal though .
They have an option for a 6 - course pre set menu , but that comes in handy if you ' re there for a long afternoon .
Vanilla frostings are not the best though .
The pastry was extremely average , because Patisserie Opera makes far more better pastries .
I had a pizza like thing called Quiche or something .
.Starting with the location its a bit out of commercial place but still accessible .
We were visiting guwahati and chanced upon loyans tried blue berry almond red velvet and others .
.taste of blueberries and almond is still lingering..for a month now .
.. its just pandara they are charging.
The best time to visit this place is after 11.
We ordered 01 Mutton Rarha which was mix of keema and goat / lamb pieces ( avoidable ) and 01 Butter Chicken ( 3 / 5 rating ) , Dal Makhani gets 4 on 5 , Chicken Biryani gets 2.9 on 5.
Let us take the butter chicken and the butter paneer for instance .
Average food , especially the stuff which I had heard as must - eats .
Some of the kebabs were actually decent , but nothing to write home about .
Now this is wot we call a cafe lounge..amazing place to chill , pricey but worth it .
