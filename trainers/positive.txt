Yellow is the dominating color in the environment with lil shades of brown and green.
First the Nachos arrived and they were really great.
Its very hard to find such quality at such reasonable price in this area.
It is a must visit.
Usually when I have to sit for hours at such places, I look for a rest room.

We were starving and didn't waste anytime in ordering food.
Our order was peri peri fries, chicken pizza ( oven baked pizza are served), spaghetti with pesto and pine nuts, and finally grilled chicken burger.
