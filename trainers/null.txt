well when you know the friends would need to have something after a hectic work through at office and they need a couple of beers to be high on .
There are days when u feel like staying at home, njoin a drink (maybe more than that) with ur friends & not go out to fancy restaurants.
But the drawback in such a scenario is after a certain time @ night everything is either shut or it's shit.

The superhero for lazy ass folks like me.
So no more standing in queues to get ur fav food on weekends.
When it's a Saturday and u really want some appetizing food which will give you a toothsome feeling.
CHEERS..!!!
Looking forward for more.
Came in handy a couple of days ago when we were starving at 2AM.
A little bit nostalgic also..
We were just trying it for the first time so cant comment.
But they really need to maintain the authenticity of the restaurant and not focus on the chinese menu, which they are.
Do yourself a favour and go somewhere else please...
but you can definitely order from there without a second thought.
Good luck Pema !
   Sometimes we dream.
Its not intentional.
Its not always planned.
And its not always cliched.
The lovely husband and wife team of Pema and Mickey dreamed of starting their own place in Delhi for many years.
Through trying times, through boring day jobs.
This is their dream coming true.
There are plans to expand slowly.
Take my word for it.
Because its just that good!

Go for it.
Cheers!

I headed over to tpot for breakfast around 11am.
I'm generally a guy who eats small meals at regular intervals of time.
