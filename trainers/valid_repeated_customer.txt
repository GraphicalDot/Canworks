A small little restaurant in a pretty busy market place.
Well for a meat lover n a fan of mughal style of cooking with no fuss involved unlike a fine dine .

Ordered rolls from here.First they sent me the wrong order.Then the veg paneer roll had a chicken bone in it.Pathetic.My guests were pure vegetarian and were very upset about getting a chicken bone in their food.
