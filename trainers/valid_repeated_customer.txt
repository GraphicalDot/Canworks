A small little restaurant in a pretty busy market place.
Well for a meat lover n a fan of mughal style of cooking with no fuss involved unlike a fine dine .

Ordered rolls from here.First they sent me the wrong order.Then the veg paneer roll had a chicken bone in it.Pathetic.My guests were pure vegetarian and were very upset about getting a chicken bone in their food.
i had visited the radisson branch when it was quite newly opened and also remember meeting cricketer mohd azharuddin .they have a fixed menu priced costs around 1100 with taxes per person for non veg menu and around 950 for vegetarian .
even though nandos remain quite occupied everytime i go , there is no doubt about the flaw less service these guys offer !
Adds up to the expectation with nice ambience , good people chilling around .
Being a fan of Nando ' s before it opened here , I deemed it essential to make a trip there at the soonest .
HOWEVER , the last time I visited ( a few weeks ago ) , I was very put off by the flies that were constantly buzzing around and sitting at our table .
Been there twice and it ' s a lovely experience .
The food and bev amount was Rs1400 .
I have since graduated to Bloody Mary and LIIT which are both well made at HRC .
I also went to HRC during their famous Burger Festival and tasted all the different burger offerings .
It happened , i was feeling mesmerized by having " Dahi ke Kabab " and of course they were much much better than my previous experience .
It held all the splendor of a time and I would definitely go back .
We had to wait a while to be seated , but we had fun just chatting and enjoying the overall energy of the placceI would definitely go back , it was a really fun
I have been a customer to them since their old days , when this joint was actually a dhaba across the nearby red light .
Unfortunately , the friend who introduced me to this place has turned vegetarian and so , I havent had the opportunity to go back .
I have been here twice.. And always had lunch buffet .
My 4th visit to this place was today .
Went with two of my friends as one of my friend told me this was nice restaurant and food was nice as well it ' s the name which is very old and famous .
I visited nandos many time when I went every time I feel goodNot comparable in taste ....Ambience niceService goodWanna to go againMust visit
Going earlier works best - the place usually has long queues and runs mostly full both times of the day / night .
My 3rd visit to Nandos , and I ' m saying , so what ' s all the fuss about !
I visited nandos in London for the first time and simply fell in love with the pita breads and some amazingly delicious chicken .
We have been long term loyal customers of Nandos from the UK and found it as good !
Went there for lunch after a long time and came out wondering why I dont go there more often .
- - - - - 21 Nov , 2013 - - - - - Have been a fan for almost 6 years now .
Have already made 4 visits so far and will continue doing so .
Nandos in Jo ' burg is a regular joint and they have beer as well .
The Bangalore outlet was at par .
Have been a fan for almost 6 years now .
I had visited Dhaba at The Claridges only once with my family and I just loved the food they offered though found it damn expensive being a student .
I had gone to this place 3 - 4 times .
Second visit here , excellent foot specially the clay oven pizzas are too good , terrace sitting is the best and well done , menu is pretty big and good have something for very taste bud , service staff can be improved , overall experience has been grat
This is my favourite restaurant .
My favourite place for Mughlai food .
These are my thoughts before I enter Bukhara everytime .
I have had food here more than a dozen times .
Wasn ' t sure to add a review for this place as I hardly know anyone who hasn ' t been here and Iv been here countless timesThe Bukhara daal still has the same taste over 20 + years .
The one thing that brings me to this place again and again is the Pad Thai they serve.it is one of the best you can find in delhi .
I have had many gratifying meals from Al Kauser over the past few years but only once took a table outside to sit and eat ; which is only doable during one of the winter months .
I am very frequent visitor of striker ' s. This one is situated in VK , Delhi.
One of my favourite places .
Geoffrey ' s has always been my favorite place to dine at .
We come here very often .
have been there twice... gr8 food .
I had come down here a few days back and I really loved it .
To be honest I had high expectations from Nandos after having Nandos in other parts of world .
Nando ' s serves probably one of the best chicken preparations in Delhi NCR .
This is the place to be .
Had tried their peri peri chicken for the first time way back in 2010 in Canada and was all in tears from the spicey marinate .
Made it a point to have nando ' s on every subsequent visit .
Ambience is great .
