As this was a takeaway order , a service charge is not expected on the billed amount .
However , a 10 % service charge was added to the bill .
It ' s a bit pricey though .
It was ok , not great and the price range was quite high for all the products .
....but too expensive .
Total value for money .
Obviousli a bit too expensive !
Well I will say it ' s a bit expensive restaurant any way that ' s my view .
Economical and yummy tooo..... .
Overpriced things .
Paying 1800 for 2 pax , without liquor , soup , salad , dessert....just chicken and lemonades .
The best part about this restaurant is that is it not very expensive or pretention .
In the expensive side .
.i was expecting to wait but surprisingly the place was half full it is definitely over priced and overrated .
All in all we paid a bill of almost Rs 20 , 000 .
To say the truth we all felt a bit cheated after leaving the place ,
..Yes it is a bit over priced .
.. everythn u will find interesting.. der is only one which will hurt u is the less quantity and taxes dey charge .
..perfectly cooked chicken...value for money .
