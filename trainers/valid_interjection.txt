The service is also pretty good .
The liquor menu was extensive .
The place has an amazing ambience and the garden especially has a really good setting .
Pathetic service .
.... must have !
.... must have !
The hookah was a bit costly ( starts from 1000 bucks + taxes ) but rest was ok .
One of best place to hang out in the middle if city where u can ' t find any other clubsI have visited this place multiple times and still plan to visit always .
I enjoyed the ambience but hated the delivery time they took to serve on table .
Dim lights with music almost preventing any conversation with thinly populated servers among a crowd of patrons .
