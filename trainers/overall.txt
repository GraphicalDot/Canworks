A good option for a quite date or general catch-up or for your alone time.
A regular hangout joint for our gang.
I have started to prefer visiting small tea/coffee shops instead of coffee chains - service, ambience and food is just so much better.
This place is very out of the box.
Overall a nice and simple place to enjoy an evening.
Things that bother: It's and the main road and I always have problems finding place to park car.
  way above our expectations... my verdict on this cafe AWESOME!!

Would surely visit again.
On saturday night, we waited for around 30 minutes to get a seat.
