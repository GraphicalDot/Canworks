Its worth the 4.3 rating on zomato because its cheap it serves some excellent pizza ' s. Well the best reason to visit this place is because the pizza ' s are just yumm and compared to other pizza corners like pizza hut and dominoes their pizzas seem very dry compared to joeys .
I ' d ordered Corn Exotica..much cheese..so yummy..so good .
A true slice of pizza or a little piece of heaven !

First dish was Garlic prawns - Good king size prawns ( not he small ones you get normally in all places ) which were really perfectly marinated and perfectly cooked .
For me it was the best dish of the evening and you must trySecond thing was Grilled Fish - Again perfect for the evening and the best part was that it melted in the mouth instantly and that is what you want from a fish dish .
Service - Truly the best , they were on the toes every - time and you did not have to even ask once for something .
But awsem food .
If ur lookin for a great place to dine , try wild dining its classicaly authentic n has a great theme ( jungle ) .
Desserts are amazing .
one of the most fabulous dinners that i had in mumbai so far .
.i loved the creation .
..the pesto kabab was awesome with a completely different tastethe jalebi cavear is also a must try .
Finally went there for dinner with my parents and was blown away by how ridiculously amazing everything looked and tasted !
We especially loved the khandvi shots they got out in the start , ; and the mushroom chai ( which is supposed to be this soup but served like chai ) was delicious !
Great service too which I think is just as important as the food in a restaurant , although there was an element in one of the dishes missing in one of the entrees my dad ordered .
Their dessert was phenomenal - jalebi caviar !
Truely amazing n new concept of food .
Awesome experience .
For the appetizers , we had pesto kabab which were simply delicious .
The " shot " of khandvi on a spoon was delicious .
For starters tried the galauti kabab which came with coin sized roti , absolutely delectable .
The kabab just melted in the mouth .
Definitely an awesome fine dine modern food eating experience .
If you ' re looking for a great meal without any budget constraints - this is the place to go to !
We loved everything so much that we wouldn ' t stop eating and well let ' s just say it didn ' t do our digestion any good !

All in all , one of my favourite restaurants in Bombay !
Landed up calling for kebabs and some starters , which were great in taste .
Staff extremely cordial .
The servers are extremely professional , which makes coming to a high end place such as this more enjoyable .
Must try the Bengali Aloo Dum - it does sound run of the mill but these guys did a good job reinventing the dish .
One of the best bakeries in the city !
If you love dark chocolate frosting , you must go here .
The other eatables , pastries , patties and stuff are really great .

Taste is awesome and service is likely
Childhood fav , I think every person in delhi must have gone to this restaurant atleast once , went here after ages , and still the food was same just delicious !
Some of tye servers were also the same when I saw them ages back when I was a kid and use to come with my mom dad , will love to go back tyere again and again and again
It is one of the best place for North Indian food in Delhi .
Amazing Punjabi food .
The breads were a mixed basket which were very good .
GULATI is the Best choice in the Pandara Road cluster of restaurants .
An ideal family restaurant where one can come in big groups to chat and enjoy food .
good food , fast and excellent service
Though pandara road has many other options , their galawati kebabs n butter chicken r to die for .
Luved it
One of the best restaurant in delhi , Nice ambience , good taste and best dal makhani in the city .
Burrah mutton was great .
Gosht ki nihari and the biryani was just too good .
Loved the nihari .
The mango cheese cake is the best I have ever had !
The overall ambience and food quality is outstanding but the best part is the unbelievable desserts !
