!the interiors are well done ( better than vk outlet ) .overall a 4 / 5 !
The Evenings makes the place beautiful and adds an extra point .
The place was well organised with nice pictures over the walls .
The waiters dance in the center every half an hour which is very unique to India .
But the place and the food is OVER - RATED .
....nice place .
Very well decorated restaurant with glass facade .
This place is a paradise.....
As for ambiance ..their is no ambiance as such .
The decor is well appointed .
Last night it felt like we were sitting at a railway station...clanging sounds , staff running around under stress , crying children with parents not bothered to attend to their kids...
Nor the store management engaging such customers .
The ambience of the place is good and so is the service staff .
The hygiene standards are pretty good and the kitchen just sort of merges into the restaurant .
It has a weighing machine which instead of telling you the weight dispenses a fortune for the day , which is like so cool .
The place has posters of old Hindi movies and play all kind of hindi songs .
The open kitchen is decorated with traditional jars and utensils .
The ceiling of the place is pretty cute .
They have made a chandlier of TAPS !
They have placed a soft drink fridge , which , you generally find at local places like a dhaba .
Basically they have given the place .
Place is super quiet .
But I wonder how will people occupy the terrace in this scorching heat ?
Cannot really eat a meal sitting on those .
In my view the most spacious restaurant in khan market .
Its such a relaxed & amp ; artistically done place for all creative n social people .
You may want to attend the event happening in the cafe or just relax n interact with like - minded people at their beautiful terrace .
So those that end up sitting on the tiny stools find it tough to hold their position for a long meal .
The only complain...those horribly uncomfortable stools and benches need to go .
Other than that , this place is beautiful .
Its well put up with graffitis..posters that elate the youth .
Till the kind of Interiors..
The coasters stating the truth .
Till the kind of crockery & amp ; cutlery we were served in.. Too cool !
..The place is not as great as their food but still it is an average and quite decent place to have dinner with your friends and family .
Indoor Sitting is small so its best either to take - away your food or have it outside .
But enough for you to make at least 6 - 8 visits before you exhaust their menuBit on the Expensive Side for a street food joint , but then they guarantee that you have the same flavor everytime you visit themThere is " ZERO " ambiance as like most of our street food joints , lots of bones , lots of dogsLots of Dirt .
Was completely empty on a week night .
The first thing that strikes you when you enter this place is it ' s enormous size !
This place is huge .
The interiors are nice , cool and different .
A huge gate on entrance with leathery stuff it just impress you on the first sight .
The music is loud and with packed up weekends , it becomes difficult to catch the waiter ' s attention however the staff is well informed .
The staff and service could be better in terms of ambient noise.
Good Hospitality and wonderfully done decor !
Although when you are on the gate of it , the entrance is not that good .
You might just ignore it and walk away .
DJ was good I would say .
Also you can ' t expect a serene din as half of the city is crammed into it .
Ambience is really nice with touches of cultures of bengal the photographs hanging on the wall are really good ( loved the photography ) other than that the food feels me homely kind .
A nice place .
..there are 2 - 3 variants of seating available..a mixture of Couch n high seats .
