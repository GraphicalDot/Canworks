!the interiors are well done ( better than vk outlet ) .overall a 4 / 5 !
The Evenings makes the place beautiful and adds an extra point .
The place was well organised with nice pictures over the walls .
The waiters dance in the center every half an hour which is very unique to India .
But the place and the food is OVER - RATED .
....nice place .
Very well decorated restaurant with glass facade .
This place is a paradise.....
As for ambiance ..their is no ambiance as such .
The decor is well appointed .
Last night it felt like we were sitting at a railway station...clanging sounds , staff running around under stress , crying children with parents not bothered to attend to their kids...
Nor the store management engaging such customers .
The ambience of the place is good and so is the service staff .
The hygiene standards are pretty good and the kitchen just sort of merges into the restaurant .
It has a weighing machine which instead of telling you the weight dispenses a fortune for the day , which is like so cool .
The place has posters of old Hindi movies and play all kind of hindi songs .
The open kitchen is decorated with traditional jars and utensils .
The ceiling of the place is pretty cute .
They have made a chandlier of TAPS !
They have placed a soft drink fridge , which , you generally find at local places like a dhaba .
Basically they have given the place .
Place is super quiet .
But I wonder how will people occupy the terrace in this scorching heat ?
Cannot really eat a meal sitting on those .
In my view the most spacious restaurant in khan market .
Its such a relaxed & amp ; artistically done place for all creative n social people .
You may want to attend the event happening in the cafe or just relax n interact with like - minded people at their beautiful terrace .
So those that end up sitting on the tiny stools find it tough to hold their position for a long meal .
The only complain...those horribly uncomfortable stools and benches need to go .
Other than that , this place is beautiful .
Its well put up with graffitis..posters that elate the youth .
Till the kind of Interiors..
The coasters stating the truth .
Till the kind of crockery & amp ; cutlery we were served in.. Too cool !
..The place is not as great as their food but still it is an average and quite decent place to have dinner with your friends and family .
Indoor Sitting is small so its best either to take - away your food or have it outside .
But enough for you to make at least 6 - 8 visits before you exhaust their menuBit on the Expensive Side for a street food joint , but then they guarantee that you have the same flavor everytime you visit themThere is " ZERO " ambiance as like most of our street food joints , lots of bones , lots of dogsLots of Dirt .
Was completely empty on a week night .
The first thing that strikes you when you enter this place is it ' s enormous size !
This place is huge .
The interiors are nice , cool and different .
A huge gate on entrance with leathery stuff it just impress you on the first sight .
The music is loud and with packed up weekends , it becomes difficult to catch the waiter ' s attention however the staff is well informed .
The staff and service could be better in terms of ambient noise.
Good Hospitality and wonderfully done decor !
Although when you are on the gate of it , the entrance is not that good .
You might just ignore it and walk away .
DJ was good I would say .
Also you can ' t expect a serene din as half of the city is crammed into it .
Ambience is really nice with touches of cultures of bengal the photographs hanging on the wall are really good ( loved the photography ) other than that the food feels me homely kind .
A nice place .
..there are 2 - 3 variants of seating available..a mixture of Couch n high seats .
Went on friday late evening , was crowed as expected .
From the enterence at ground floor the place looks small , but the place is huge !
I visited this joint with a friend and found it preety gloomy inside .
The emphasis on blue was so much that all the pictures clicked came in blue shade .
Its a basic place with no frills but seems clean .
They played skini lover , for god ' s sake .
And they have this little bookshelf of very interesting books , such as notes on a scandal and nacropolis .
Their long walls are covered with graffiti of a redefined Ahmedabad , with its iconic heriatge buildings and the modern culture like iim , industries etc ; all juxtaposed with images of fruits and juices flowing all over the place .
When they say High ultra they don ' t really lie its way up .
421 feet ( I guess I ' m right ) You feel top of the world , hands down , it ' s the best rooftop lounge in Bangalore .
When we arrived they gave us a area which has been designed as a jail cell .
I especially like the display of bandooks ( guns ) .
The carpet hangings on the faux ceiling are a novel touch .
60 ML is nice place with nice interiors ( hopefully you will never get chance see this because maximum time light are off ) .
Beautiful place .
About the crowd or gentry i cant say much coz when i went to this place it was almost empty .
The interiors are rather dark and lit with neon and jazzy lit red lamps and wall units .
The interiors are rather dark and lit with neon and jazzy lit red lamps and wall units .
The most amazing view of bangalore metro , mg road and parade grounds .
So you get a royal feeling from the moment you enter the place !
One of the most beautiful restaurant in town .
Great sitting areas with white pebbles .
The perfect romantic place .
The place is extremely well organized and decorated with green plantation .
They have various sitting options , including open and covered .
The night life is what would make you fall in love with the place .
One of the best places in this part of delhi for a romantic dinner !
A quaint little place just adjacent to lodhi gardens .
The luxury of this place begins as soon as you enter the lift .
Ambience And Service ~ Ambience And Service Is Pretty Good And Fast .
.. spacious
Firstly what a place !
But looks can be very deceptive like they say .
Needless to mention that the place itself is pretty big and nicely decked up .
Decor : It instantly reminded me of the typical Pune and Mumbai lanes .
They used vintage items such as old telephone and a model airplane .
I loved the quirky display of glass jars filled with candies..very typical in Parsi stores .
The pink color looked beautiful .
We decided to Try ' White Waters ' .Its a nice restro with the outdoor seating , opp .
It ' s located at an excellent location among the greenery of lodhi garden and the setup is super .
Don ' t try eating food here , else you ' ll have to get it packed for your pets .
I loved the decor and the set up .
Great interiors !
The outdoor seating is extremely well done and provides a feel good factor both in the day as well as evening time .
This well lit and well designed restaurant is a welcome break from the monotonous eateries from this part of the world .
The interiors as mentioned earlier also is quite good and traditional .
It brings back the feeling of a bengali restaurant .
Decorated nicely with old masterpieces and really beautifully clicked photographs .
It is a small joint and during lunch hours had to wait to get a table .
Really happy with the minute details they considered while designing the place .
If you visit there just spend time looking at the pictures of Bengal , the " Ekla Chalo Re " art work , the antique furniture .
Don ' t forget to go through the collection of books they have till the time food is been served .
Place is so crampy .
Plus they have good music on and the service is good .
Beautiful cozy interiors .
Just enjoy your drink and groove to the great artists who would play there !
Having a drink with your friends , 100 feet up in the air , under the Stars , with the whole ( almost ) Kolkata skyline in front of you .
....however one thing the authorities should look into is the non functioning escalator thats reqd to be rode to reach the restaurant.....a trouble for the aged....hope dat gets sorted quickly .
The terrace is good for winter lunch or bearable summer dinner and drinks .
The inside section is too dark and dingy for my liking .
Personal party @ the M - floor : being away from the main floor service was a challenge , air con sucks..
No wonder whenever u enter this place , it ' s all wooden .
Nice interiors .
Amazing interiors as well .
The layout is pretty standard with all the cutleries on the table .
Great environment .
.. very aesthitically done up .
relaxing interiors .
Top floor makes it more glamours then it could be .
The view you get is just awesome with cold breezy air.1000 bucks with cover .
Flip side : the restaurant turn into a club on week ends , the two bar counter are always crowded so getting a drink is kind of tough .
With an amazing rooftop lounge at some 32nd floor of a high - rise , a perfect setting unfortunately they have been able to cash in on the place !
Pyramid like place , formerly MOS a lot of year back , now a really fresh change .
And the crowd was super charged .
So , its a romantic place .
You have greenery around .
You have breeze around .
So , its a romantic place .
AWESOME .
..love the rooftop , the people .
One of the finest longues....
The cherry on the cake is the huge screen that they have .
As the name suggests , this place has interiors like a jail with waiters dressed up in stripes and one person roaming around like a superintendent .
The song selection is good .
.crowd was nice..ambienc was really good .
.. i did not like the seatng arrangement much .
A rooftop restaurant with good food quality service and nice view .
Amazing view .
The best time is to come during the sunset to enjoy the beautiful view .
View is superb I mean u can c half bangalore from top .
Prefer sitting outside .
Plus it was drizzling to add to the sheer beauty of the place .
Excellent decor and good .
Awesome place !
We had a fabulous candle light dinner .
Undoubtedly the prettiest place to be .
This place scores even before entering inside , the Blue door it is !
Moreover , this is also your ticket to see Mumbai ' s real estate situation personified - cramped seating , limited space to move around .
And a decent effort by the DJ to bring energy into the Karaoke night .
The icing on the cake was the presence of around 100 - 200 bugs / mosquitoes at the same level as the food plates .
Love all the Burmese dolls and umbrellas around the place .
The ambiance is good the service is also good .
.Awesome food n also light on pocket !
best candle light dinner in Bangalore .
You will love the scene from 13th floor .
I guess they have two different sections one for food and the other for liquor and sheesha .
A giant screen ensures you won ' t miss out on any sports action .
Interiors is no less .
Air is huge , spacious .
The place is very tastefully done and has amazing interiors ( and exteriors considering half the place is outdoor ) .
EDM on weekdays too at least for now .
with a well known DJ .
Big screens all around .
The worst part of it all were the flies .
There were flies everywhere .
But what ' s unexpected in a city like Chennai is that the ambience is brilliant and the staff is very motivated and witty .
The ambiance is nice , and the best part is the singers who put life into the place , post 10pm .
They could have so much more crowd and people if they just time down the volume .
With their eye catching decor , the fancy beer tubes , that sporty feel and the various games , they give out an impression of a typical sports bar you would find abroad .
The only worst part I could find is crowd .
Dress code !
Completely PACKED !
Romantic .
Refreshing .
I absolutely loved the decor at the place .
But as soon as we informed them , they brought him another dish .
You hv decent sitting soace so can go with family too .
The place is predictably noisy as the Delhi families feel completely at home over here .
The entrance of this place smells like anything !
Pretty small I will say .
And must say interiors are good and classy .
One of its kind with white and grey combination .
Though DJ took time to make us groove on hit numbers but soon he made up for the delay .
As we went inside , it was packed and the interesting decor choices stood out immediately .
( cherry on d top ) Music was amazing n foot tapping .
Crowd was so so good .
Where the aroma of a morning coffee or a freshly baked pie welcome you !
..Just excuse the ambience and order any dish.. .
The only problem this place has is lack of proper arrangements for people to have their food .
The place has its own life .
By this I mean that the vibrance of the place especially after dusk its something else !
The sitting area can be a bit off .
So if you know who ' s playing the night , and you like the genre , this is the place to be .
The shamianas are very neatly made and maintained .
If it was just for looks I would rate it 4.5 on 5.
They have given it a rusty look and it seems some serious cost cutting is done in the ambience of the place .
but still for an upmarket place it ' s kinda shabby.with paint chipping of and dirty in some places .
The place also had a couple of artists performing .
Amazing interior .
Perfect place for a date .
Exterior / interior : Nicely done exteriors and interiors of the place .
Yes , you feel tropical as you enter .
Definitely worth for a romantic dinner , if u want to initiate a spark in your partner , the ambience at ebony definitely helps ( only take seats at he balcony for the effect .
Romantic fr sure
Classy place for a perfect romantic date .
Indoor sitting , outdoor sitting and a small hall as disc .
dnt Ever visit replay....a disc without a DJ..is like a band Wala repeating same songs..and playing full songs ....and if you are visiting for having dinner..then it is good .
Nice ambience nice coffee salads ...worth it
Great place to hang out especially in overcast and winter conditions....don ' t miss grill veg salad and pickle tickle sandwich....u will love it .
Parking is a major headache during weekends .
It ' s quite a cosy one .
The outer courtyard is quite small and is only sufficient to seat a family of max.
6 people and has table tops for people who wanna enjoy a drink or two and just have fun .
Two other sections are layed out , one on first floor of their part and a small inner hall .
