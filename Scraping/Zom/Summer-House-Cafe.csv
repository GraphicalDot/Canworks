Its located in the Aurbindo market opposite the church. Its made at the same place what used to be Kabila restaurant for many years before they shut down last year.  Coming to Summer house cafe , its made beautifully with sitting available both inside and outside.  The inside sitting is huge and spacious and very well spread out. There is a fabulous bar right in front of you as soon as one enters the restaurant.  The service is good and quick,  music is good.  I loved the whole feel of the place  . We had warm chicken salad and non vegetarian mezze platter, it was basically a quick lunch . The portions are good and the food taste is good.

The food is impressive, the non-veg mezze platter we ordered had a good combination of different meats and accompaniments. The lamb chops were a disappointment. The meat was too tough and smothered in sauce. It would have been good to have the option of the sauce on the side so you can taste the meat on its own and add the sauce as required. The hostess was kind and offered my table a round of shots when she heard we were there to celebrate one of our friend's becoming a new Dad. A kind gesture that is exactly the kind of thing that makes a good experience great. The staff were efficient but noticed a distinct drop in service after the hostess left.

Both the dishes were not good and to sum them up in one word, 'bland'.  We tried the virgin mojito, nutella and hazelnut shake and coffee and hazelnut shake.

We had the macroni salad and hummus as appetizer..so yummy we had to order a mezze platter. I had a Greek salad &amp; chicken pasta after. The pasta was delicious OMG.

This is not at the main strip of HKV which is goddam relief because the crowd scene there has become uncontrollable. Have you tried going there on a Fri or Sat night. Better best avoided - unless you're fond of massive crowds at closing time with no empty auto in sight.So this place was a little quite for 8PM on a saturday. That said, loved the ambience! The well done al fresco dining area is such a pleasure as well except probably not very apt for Delhi summers.We were not very hungry so we ordered two starters along with our beers.1) Sizzled Red Chicken: Yummy chicken skewers a bit on the spicy side. They tone down the spice if you tell them to.2) Stuffed sausages in Bacon.: This was so GOOD! nicely done sausages wrapped in bacon strips.

There is always a tall man downstairs who greets you as you go up the Parisian stairs (exaggeration) and then once up you have about five tables outside with fans and you have inside.The inside has been left kind of empty which is awesome because it gives young folk the area to socialize.

Very well presented as you can see in the photo and tasted real good. Nachos were well baked and the platter had variety of things among them best were the cheese nuggets. Then for Mains we ordered Veg. Lasagna and Mushroom Alfredo sauce with Penne Pasta. The pasta had a nice creamy mushroom sauce with wheat Garlic breads on the sides ..Great taste! But on the other hand, Lasagna was a disappointment. Loads of vegetables with black pepper... not so good!At the end, for desert ordered a Tiramisu.

We were quickly ushered to an outside balcony table offering a rather wonderful view.The food &amp; service we experienced was consistently outstanding. The prawn, meat loaf, ham and cheese sandwich starters were all thoroughly appealing and presented more like scrumptious works of food art. We enjoyed the tiramisu which was served with a different presentation and was really yum. Everyone agreed that this is an amazing restaurant." 307490 "2014-03-26 01:19:21" 27 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/vQAPk 9 1395776961.0
