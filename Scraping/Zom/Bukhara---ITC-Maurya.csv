Amazing how they've managed to hoodwink people into believing that they serve the best dal makhni on the planet when any neighbourhood dhaba can perhaps give you a better rendition. Heck for my money the best dal makhni I've ever had was at the kitchen of the Karol Bagh Traders' Association club (no idea if still in existence). Those lalas sure know their food!The first time I tasted this tomato puree laden atrocity I thought I had landed in the wrong restaurant. The meal only kept getting worse because the kebabs we ordered were sinewy, chewy and just generally awful. They also forgot to bring something we had ordered and weren't the least bit apologetic about it.Also, this is perhaps one of the few places I've been to in India where the servers are rude and indifferent to you if you're not a) a white person or b) a local baller who can obviously throw down the big bucks.So let's see - mediocre food...read more" 2742 "2014-08-30 20:29:14" 30  https://www.zomato.com/review/rnnEKp  1409410754.0

Also, undoubtedly, their staff is very courteous and would try and make your meal as enjoyable as possible. But as I see it, it is more about the experience of visiting the place and dining their than the food itself. The way they give an apron to cover oneself, the way their kitchen is designed with a glass wall, all adds to the experience and the fun of it.I do not think many people know (or that many care for it, but for those who do), that they even prepare their dal without onion and garlic. You just need to call them a day in advance and ask them to prepare it.However, one thing that I would like to object to is their new policy of not allowing children before 10:00 PM for dinner." 2742 "2014-08-28 19:34:12" 12 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/AKNzMP  1409234652.0

The dal had little bit of more spice in it as it was not expected by me but fair enough.The best thing was that they had this tradition to eat with hands.The table next to me was occupied by some business crowed and i think they were some north east and they were literately licking there and taking pictures of the huge bread served to them.I wish they had non veg with curry.Over all experience was not that bad but it was not as per my expectation." 2742 "2014-08-12 22:47:40" 2 Good https://www.zomato.com/review/DDBPwm 1 1407863860.0

The dal was very rich in taste and definitely their signature dishes are to be relished. The only mistake was ordering the naan bukhara. It was too big for four of us and kind if started to dry and get hard very quickly. I would suggest to order the naan bukhara if there are like 7 to 8 people.

Extremely. Although probably not more than any other Indian restaurant in a 5-star hotel - and this is The Indian restaurant! Plus the helpings are more generous than your average restaurant.Ambience? Rustic. Designed to look like a North-West Frontier village. Nice, but a little noisy. Not the best seating - the table for two had stools - no backrest.

A lot of good, lesser priced places serve very similar kebabs and tikkas. However, eye catching dishes like the naan bukhara which is basically a single naan (indian oven cooked bread) serving the entire table. What this place does is gives really good food and adds elements to make it a whole new experience. Right from the ambience to their cutlery, the authenticity of the regions feel is not lost in the quagmire of capitalistic makeup. Overall a place one must visit one. And do try their daal, but as goes with all food, don't eat expecting magic.

It's heavenly . Food for the gods. Review for last two visits .Visit one ( with husband ) awesome great amazing . Everything ' muaaah ' dal , paneer tikka , chicken tikka. Maza aa Gaya .Visit 2 , (parents , hubby n kid) Dal - as amazing as ever. !! I can even dream abt this !! Paneer tikka- dry Acc to Bukhara standards. Chicken tikka - not so good . Slightly disappointed .After all the restaurant IS a little expensive so you don't like to waste that kinda dough on average tasting food .But never the less I am still a fan of Bukhara and hope to visit again soon." 2742 "2014-04-30 22:03:00" 5 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/OZNvP  1398875580.0

The apron thing was a little too much. they tie apron on you as if we are new to north Indian cuisine. The Dal Bukhara was over hyped. It was good but I had better Dal at some of the very simple places in Delhi.  Chicken Tikkas were good. Paneer Tikka was ok. This restaurant is running because of the reputation and hype is generated over years. I was happy that I finally visited the place. Killer pricey. Table for 2 cost around 10K. but as long as people are coming and throwing money it is cool. more over its a place for special occasion or to bring your NRI relatives to. So its ok. Will be visiting again. The hype wins this time over food.   the rating for food is 2.5. but the awesomeness of the place and the buzz is worth 3.5" 2742 "2014-03-31 15:17:47" 39 Good https://www.zomato.com/review/GKnxa 1 1396259267.0

But this time it was extremely tasty! I licked my plate clean kind of tasty! The chicken Malai Tikka was huge chunks or very well cooked chicken. Paneer Tikka was again huge chunks with the right addition of black pepper. Naan was tasty but a little thick for my liking.By the end of our meal, the four of us were full till the neck and completely satisfied with our food.

We had a 50% discount card so we ventured out for a lunch on a weekday.. Even then, it was packed..For a regal and authentic feel of great Indian Mughlai food, this is the place to go.. The Dal Bukhara is legendary and it lives to its name.. Barrah Kebab was quiet succulent though the Paneer disappointed us a bit..I like the fact that unlike other high end restaurants, the options here are limited.. And that is a good thing !!!All said and done, the meal for 2 cost us abt 7k though with the discount, it worked out to 3500..Worth it???

I was expecting magic. What I got instead did not even come close. After hearing about the famous Dal Bukhara which has supposedly wowed many celebrities, I was disappointed with what finally came to the table. I found it rather ordinary. The paranthas and naans we ordered were decent. The Tandoori Chicken and kebabs were very good but again nothing out of the extraordinary. The presentation of the dishes was rustic. The seating was fairly basic and in fact a little uncomfortable.

When I was studying in the US, it was craze amongst everyone there, Indians and foreigners alike who loved the packaged dal ITC had launched. And they were mortified when I scoffed at the dal saying its like eating chemicals but thats because I have had the real thing and it wasnt even close to it. When my friends came to Delhi and had the real thing, they all agreed what they had in the past was actual crap.But, my problem with Bukhara is the lack of gravy options. The quality of food and flavor is all really good but if someone like me wants some gravy in there meals, they are lacking options.

Agreed that if you have some core competencies then its good to focus on them rather than having a large menu but I guess its now time to go in for a menu expansion coz its too limited. The world famous dal bukhara is good and so is the family sized naan bukhara but apart from that nothing much to really write home about. Paneer tikka and tandoori aloo are average. They can prepare kadhai paneer on request which again is just ordinary and dry.. The seating has become uncomfortable as there is no back rest. The ambience is decent but I any day now prefer to head to dumpukht for a richer dining experience.

Dal bukhara is not to be missed.I am a hard core non vegetarian yet I didn't miss to order the daal.We opted for the fixed menus (expensive but wider menu choices). I focussed more on non veg, while wifey focussed more on veggies. We were both happy this way. But is suspect my grin was wider.Raan was to die for...kababs were succulent and delicious.Need I say anything about service which was tops..Overall.
