In my case, I like the idea of going to 360, especially if somebody else is paying, because nobody forces me to give my car to a valet for parking. I absolutely detest the idea of that and it is included in my go/no go decision making for eating out.Sure, some places one can go by bus, metro, cycle or even by foot, but for formal meals, having own wheels around is a good idea, unless drinking.The next reason is that this used to be called ""The Coffee Shop"" in a day and age when ""Soup of the Day"" came with unlimited bread and that boiled vegetables in vinegar kind of side. I am now talking about the '70s, before it became the Palms, and now is 360.So, to try to review 360 - they have all sorts of food, you can go nuts choosing.

I tried everything from fresh off the griddle dosas to immersing myself in maple and chocolate syrup pancakes.Wow. Just Wow. If you want to treat yourself to a fantastic feast fit for royalty, try this one. I absolutely loved the fruit yogurt and i forgot, the scones.

The service, ambience, decor etc is all very nice. The staff are well trained well spoken well informed. The interiors are beautiful without a doubt..but the food served at the brunch today was not upto the mark not just for a five star but for any restaurant. The presentation and the layout is done tastefully. The selection is limited but also acceptable..but the food was tasteless, bland and simply put lacked culinary skill ! What has happened ? I use to love this place.. The champagne wine selection etc is all very nice but what use ..if the food is terrible. For three of us we paid about 11000 rs and left unsatisfied. I do not think I would be visiting this place let alone recommending it to anyone for that matter." 1849 "2013-03-31 17:21:14" 32 Poor http://www.zomato.com/review/lMxOn 1 1364730674.0

We went with the regular Thai green curry, I must say.. it was delicious. The Jasmine rice served with it was extremely flavorful. The Prawn tempura's did need improvement. It was not as crispy fried , as we are used to.The service put us off ...Overall - Food was goodService - Snobbish, inattentive and sometimes rude.Ambiance is like a regular 24 hr cafe.. lively and busy" 1849 "2013-03-08 00:03:01" 10 Average http://www.zomato.com/review/QPvyP  1362681181.0

I have been going there for several years now, and such is their range, that I always find something new and interesting in the menu to try. It gives you a welcome break from the rest of the restaurants in other 5 stars and offers you a fun and vibrant place to eat. The best part about this restaurant is that they have their own Sushi bar.This trendy and fashionable restaurant offers you North Indian, Chinese, Japanese and Italian food. It definitely is one of the bigger restaurants in the city with ample seating, but still reservations are recommended at this place, as it can get packed sometimes, because of its popularity.I would not suggest you to try the North Indian food over here(not that its bad or anything, its just that its not the best in the city, and I would want to divert your attention towards something that is the best over here).

Simple and professional.Due to it's strategic location, it makes for a perfect place for meeting business associates, although I have come here for family dinners as well.The staff is extremely courteous (as the hotel is a business hub for the traveling executive) and the food is simply spectacular. You can easily order anything from the menu blindly without being disappointed. It helps that the dishes are moderately priced.If you are looking to entertain a large party, this is the ideal restaurant." 1849 "2012-11-10 11:45:14" 80 "Very Good" http://www.zomato.com/review/yaOwv  1352528114.0

Pretty bad experice both in terms of service and food. Had ordered Garlic Bread and Pizza - the service was as if we were some unwanted guests and they were doing us a favour by serving us. The Garlic bread that came was pretty hard as if like a bread toast - when we raised this issue they relented after a lot of arguing and brought back the portion minus what we had tasted (just how cheap such a big restaurant can get was demonstrated here). Pizza was also of no great taste. We left pretty dissatisfied and almost hurt by their service levels." 1849 "2011-07-13 20:50:47" 24 Poor http://www.zomato.com/review/QBab 10 1310570447.0
