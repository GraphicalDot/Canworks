So we went there one weekday evening (recommend reserving a table) and were already impressed by the location of this restaurant. Sitting in a quiet corner of Friends Colony, the culinary experience is something to look forward to. I went all Veg but was quite impressed by the food on my plate. The carefully curated menu by the Chef makes you want to try almost everything on the menu. Though I personally didn't try but I'd recommend you give Chef Tasting Menu a shot. I am doing that the next time I go. Also special mention to the staff being polite and courteous. Added to the entire experience. Only negative was the mosquitoes that made us shift back inside.

On my next 2 trips to Delhi, we somehow couldn't figure out where the place was, or dint have enough time to do full justice to the place; so the third time over I did my research and made sure I had  a reservation for 2. At first glance, I thought it was a usual desi food place with fresh flowers in the decor and of course it was the lavish, gourmet kinda place. But the real experience began only after we were seated comfortably next to a glass wall that overlooked their outdoor space.

I fell in love with this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service staff was courteous, the ambience was elegant and the whole dinner was a class apart. The food- mutton, fish, duck, pork, parantha, rice, chocolate kulfi and doda- was made with care and it showed, the presentation was such that it was a delight just looking at the artistic way each dish was plated. The staff was polite and well mannered. A special mention for the palate cleanser served: it was delicious and extremely cute, it was a big part of the dinner.I'd recommend this restaurant to everyone. It's definitely worth a visit.Thank you Indian Accent for making me fall in love with food all over again." 2004 "2014-07-11 19:32:06" 2 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/NyDbX  1405087326.0

The food was actually fantastic, as was the service, but my issue is that it was actually just a little bit too orthodox. You see I grew up in London where we happen to have some of the finest 'Modern Indian' restaurants in the world. Many will scoff at this, but what you should realise is that many of the chefs are actually Indian - it's simply that the market in London is far more open to paying for what they offer than is currently the case here...which is understandable. The problem with Indian Accent, in my opinion, is that too many concessions have been made to make the food more acceptable to the mainstream. As a result, what you get here is actually a fairly orthodox experience in terms of the flavours on offer (although admittedly brilliantly executed), with the innovation coming in the form of witty presentation.Certainly then my score is a little harsh if one were to purely...read more" 2004 "2014-07-11 15:53:18" 15  https://www.zomato.com/review/YMOyK 2 1405074198.0

But given the pricing, did not find anything unique about the restaurant - neither with the ambience nor the flavours!Had the non-vegetarian tasting menu but the entire 4 or 5 course(can't remember exactly) was not even the best attempt at fusion Indian food, have had much better stuff at pseudo Indian restaurants in DC and New York and it clearly was not authentic Indian cuisine.Also the wine selection by glass needs a serious relook as i suspect not everyone  is going to be spending an extra 3000+ doing the wine pairing with the tasting menuIn summary - Probably best suited for important clients or friends and family visiting from overseas" 2004 "2014-07-06 18:07:54" 11 Good https://www.zomato.com/review/pXeDQ  1404650274.0

I am sure you'll know it is rated highly in the whole of Asia and the World and it lives upto all the hype.At first i was a bit skeptical about going here, thinking Indian Fusion would never excite me, but boy was i wrong. Using the best of North India and fusing it with Western Cuisines can not be done any better.The experience is quite amazing and without going much into the details i would HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND it to everyone. I am sure, just like me you wouldn't get enough of it by going only once, you would want to go there till you have tried every dish at least once and some things you would want repeatedly.To conclude, i need not say much about the dishes or experience, just go and try it.

Every item excited the tastebuds. The Potato puff chaat with crispy karela was such a delightful explosion of crunch, tang, bitter and sweet. The John Dory was fried to crispy perfection and the moilee sauce was the perfect contrast in its silkiness. The chef very kindly had us taste the goat cheese stuffed pepper, serious goodness! The duck Cornetto was a high and we were all surprised when it disappeared so quickly. What a clever idea to serve it perched in a shot glass filled with moong daal moth instead of the decorative lentils that European chefs (except Olivier Roellinger of course!) use. The only low was the heavy chocolate rumball which was in direct contrast to the lightness of everything else we ate. A smaller portion or a less thick portion of the John Dory might work better as this is a tasting menu and the dishes keep coming.

I had hit the last month of my pregnancy and we knew we had a bleak future of Domino's takeaways (yuck) and leftover vegetable sandwiches waiting for us. We'd been dying to try out Indian Accent ever since we saw chef Manish Malhotra in action in NDTV's Foodistan. I had been warned by a friend that it had a three-month waiting list, but I called and asked for a reservation just two hours later. None other than MM himself picked up the phone and told me politely to buzz off. Which I expected. However, he called back 10 minutes later and said that, yes, indeed, a reservation had been miraculously cancelled five minutes ago and we could come for the 7pm sitting. Right. I thought the whole charade was a little off-putting but we were excited about trying the grub. The restaurant is located in The manor, a charming little boutique hotel in Friends Colony.

The flavors across the board were generally very good without being awe-inspiring, the exception for me being the Chef's take on aloo chaat and his pairing of it with a wedge of watermelon. Unique for me; I'd never tasted that combination before and it worked well for my unsophisticated palate.In terms of service, it was generally excellent.

I don't think the restaurant adapts well to the character of the city it is in. There is a sense of awkwardness to the menu and the food when it arrives to the table. Go there if you are into trying new things, but don't expect wonders. It is a bit steep." 2004 "2010-10-14 05:00:42" 5 Poor https://www.zomato.com/review/qevA 2 1287012642.0

Although Magik and Varq are in the same league, Indian Accent was about one step ahead.The service is outstanding and the setting is lovely, away from the city jungle. The pricing is similar to any luxury hotel restaurant but the offering is something completely unique and well worth it.Look out for the sampling menus." 2004 "2010-09-15 12:39:12" 39 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/KeKM 4 1284534552.0
