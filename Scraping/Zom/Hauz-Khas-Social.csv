Went to this place yesterday for a lazy Sunday lunch(The weather was perfect for it).The entrance was smelly and then there is shady passage you have to walk to enter this surprising large place with a great look and feel. This place had a potential to get 5 rating in my books but it did not. So here is the break up of my RatingPROS- Excellent space to meetup with friends(Aside from the weird entrance). Good interiors and crowd- Love the quirky menu. Some1 has put lot of time and effort to make it and after reading it you tend to order more than you can eat.- Large portions of food. Gives a very satisfying feel- Great Shakes and presentation (Oreo shake came in flower pot and ice tea came in mini bath tub)CONS- Food in taste and prep is average.

While I write this review my only pain point is that all I have done so far is try their cocktails. I still have to try their food menu. But if cocktails are anything to go by, I am assuming food will be 4/5 at least.Speakeasy in Gurgaon is my standard for cocktails in Delhi. Hauz Khas Social with their old smoke, two souls, and acharoska come a close second. My 3 points on this place,- try cocktails, especially Acharoska and Old Smoke.- get in a bit early on weekend as the place is teeming with people and tables are hard to get. They have really comfortable seating.- have shots and do step out for a smoke. ;)@ Hauz Khas Social, you have a great place and wonderful team at work. Music, however, needs your attention.

And finally when you get a table either you dont like it or its too small for your party. And the attitude the management has is not the one you call hospitality at all. I dont think they even read these reviews. It's like - can't you see we are doing so good, be thankful atleast you're getting a place to sit. So what if the ac is not working and the water from the leaking ac unit is adding altogether a different flavour to your drink and food.So why do you go to such place when you have tonnes of options around. Answer is the ambience, the vibe the crowd. Those of you who used to party 8-9 yrs back might be familiar with the name 'calypso' this is opened in place of that.

After hearing rave reviews about the place, I decided to check out the place along with a friend of mine on a Monday hoping for a quiet lunch with minimal crowd. To our dismay, the place was jam packed and teeming with an endless queue of waiting people. We luckily managed to get a seat but unfortunately, where we were seated was right aplomb in the middle of the serving area. As a result, we were frequently disturbed by the constant comings and going of the staff. We ordered a Paneer Makhani Biryani for my friend and The Elvis Presley French Toast for myself. The biryani was excellent, though the same cannot be said for the french toast which was hard to eat at the crust and the toffee sauce would stick to your teeth thus making it harder to chew.

Ever since I fervently waited for this place to open . They opened the Delhi outpost a month before than that of Bombay ( Colaba ). This place is huge and boasts a picturesque view of the lake. However, like the Bombay counterpart, it scores low on food. Visiting during lunch hours is recommended since it's quite empty and serene.

Although I had no issues with the service, I have to say it was quite the disappointment. The drinks were very interestingly and attractively presented in beakers, injections and I think I even spotted a mini bathtub on another table. The food however was where they lost me. Their hot wings were not hot but sickeningly sweet. The sausages were something I can get from any generic meat shop in the city, the baked potatoes were insipid. The only thing I liked perhaps were the blueberry pancakes which were just the right amount of fluffy and not excessively sweet. I might go back but only to grab a few drinks.

Finally I got an opportunity to eat there and thankfully found a table as well. We ordered two breakfast trays and a Chinese box and one vada pao. The only dish remotely edible was the vada pao. The breakfast trays had pan cakes full of baking soda. And over cooked fried eggs. The food was served in dog dishes. And worst of all the iced tea was served in a bath tub contraption. It was the worst food I had event tasted. And the thing that's most disappointing is that it's such a waste of a gorgeous setting.

The place is quite innovative, and has very successfully understood and captured the market, almost completely, so much that they other places are left vacant even on weekends.So after waiting for 30 mins, just looking around, we were sure we wouldn't get a table.

The style of service is distinct with no compromise in the taste! A 5/5 for the drinks.Food &amp; Service: We ordered Chakhna (peanuts) which was again packed in a steel tiffin and was a great idea! The Sausage fest and Chicken Bao were awesome! The sausage fest was a platter of different sausages, they tasted good and the quantity was sufficient. The Chicken bao is something I highly recommend, it's like a pita pocket with a chicken stuffing. It tasted different and was nothing like I had before!

The mash had no seasoning whatsoever. Although the texture was really smooth (as it ought to be), without seasoning the entire dish goes out the window. The beef steak in itself had no flavours and the sauce was scant, to say the least. Kudos to the restaurant however, that they ask you if you like it medium or well-done.

Love the atmosphere inside and the space is amazing. Also their drinks are very reasonably priced. We tried the deconstructed Moscow mule and the screwdriver and both were very nice. Their presentation was very good too.Big issue with the place is that there is no phone signal inside and even the wifi there doesn't work! We were waiting for some friends to join us but given our phones were without signal our friends ended up waiting outside till one of us realised our phones were out and went outside to look for them. The place gets packed by 10:30/11pm and so people aren't allowed in which is why our friends had to wait for us to fetch them.Also we waited almost an hour for our food but it never showed up. In the end some of us went across the street to eat. However when we tried to get back in they wouldn't allow us back in (obviously as the place was full) and we again had to wait for our friends to realise...read more" 308322 "2014-07-13 21:22:34" 25  https://www.zomato.com/review/RyXXz  1405266754.0

It's an experience in itself. I was so blown away by the sheer enormity of the place. It makes you feel Delhi isn't so crowded after all. With so many levels like the decks of a ship and a view from the huge window that makes you feel like you're in a forest, it is quite a soothing ambience. Very different from the usual decor in other places at hkv. The decor is rustic and stripped down and extremely contemporary at the same time. The cutlery reminds you of the plates in the prison from an 80s bollywood film.I would've given it a 4.5 if they wouldn't have screwed up our order so much (Got the wrong order twice). I think that's because the place is new and they still haven't sorted out the roles assigned to everyone. The food was pretty decent though. But, do not order the doughnut sundae.

While entering through the dimly lit tunnel, one doesn't really imagine this kind of a setup at the end of it. Spread over an enormous area, it is a surprise to the eyes. With a variety of cocktails and yummy food to chose from, the whole raw and earthy feeling about the place makes it the latest talk of the town. You can find this place full at any given time of the day. The staff is extremely courteous and know their job well. The cocktails are a must try. Especially old smoke, a whiskey based cocktail. The presentation skills take one back to your school science lab with beakers and tubes of all shapes and sizes. A must try in food is the minced chicken baida roti and awesomosas (really awesome samosas). Decently priced for what all the place has to offer.

I am not a fan of HKV outlets most of them turning out to be heavily over rated. However this place is seriously rocking. its a huge place with a stunning view of the lake. Though we went at night, I am sure afternoon lunch here will also be perfect.Coming to food, the devil wings are  killer. Move aside Nandos, these wings are soo hot, that you cannot have them without a drink. Bonnafie Cronut is yummm and so was everything else we ordred from the menu. The only let down was the cocktails. The signature ones are pretty average, stick to the basics like LIIT and you will be good.Finally, a place that is worth the trouble of finding a parking space for 30 mins :)" 308322 "2014-07-12 09:09:26" 108 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/wewnE 5 1405136366.0

I was so happy.Fish tacos - a 2.8I had to ask for sour cream and salsa (which is okay). Was okay.Banana bruto (I think) - 0.5Do not order it.The place is cheap money vise, brilliant ambience and food wise. Would I go there again, most definitely.

The entrance to Hauz Khas Social is a little obscure (what restaurant's isn't in HKV), but once inside and you would be pleasantly surprised. The interiors are spacious and welcoming, done up in muted shades of brown, black and beige. On a weekday, the inside was not too crowded. The music volume was just right - we managed to actually talk to each other.Despite Delhi's humid heat, we chose to sit outside. There were worn sofas to sink in and wooden benches to curl up on - we tried both and we liked both. The rustic exteriors were more than comfortable.Everything about Hauz Khas Social is innovative - from its menu to the way they serve food and even the box they bring the bill in, a lot of loving thought has gone into the tiniest of details.We ordered the Coke n Cane, Trip on a Drip and the Ferrero Rocher Shake (wayyy too sweet for me).

Here's a disclaimer. It's not a dish for a single person.  share it. lots of peanut butter and toffee sauce.The thai curry and the goan prawn curry were really really good too. Maybe they could've served more rice, but eh.The surf n turf teriyaki had the most incredible sauce accompaniment. Not too tangy, like many teriyaki sauces end up being.Can't seem to recall the names of the other dishes but omnomnomnomThe Suresh n Ramesh dessert was good, but my colleagues weren't over the moon after having it.
