Raasta in Hauz Khas village is the place to go to. The decor is good,outdoor and indoor seating is really nice, outdoor is just lovely, especially when the weather compliments it.The cocktails here are really awesome.The LIT's here are amazing,one of the best places i know where you get the best of those kinds. choice of drinks here is just fine,pretty much everything is available. The food isn't really something to talk home about, but the drinks, the seating, the ambiance and good music lets that slip away and still makes it a good place to chill out at.

We ordered veg barbados platter and honey sesame potatoes along with drinks with no scope left for mains. Honey sesame potatoes were amazing but the platter didnt impress much. For desert we tried hot chocolate souffle..which was the best part! For all this the bill came upto 3900 which felt a bit too pricey but we had ordered 4 drinks so that was justified may be.

So last weekend, it was decided that HKV it is and no place else.Now, going there on a Saturday night would be a nightmare, I had heard this from friends but not believed them, especially when the time in my watch was over 11:00 pm. Got stuck the moment we took a left for HKV and it took close to 30 minutes and a lot of intervention from the cops to make the traffic move. Parked the moment I got space since that seemed to be a really intelligent idea then rather than moving on and on looking for a place closer to the pub we were supposed to visit.We had no place in mind, we had thought that where ever we like the ambiance and the music, we will just sit. 5 minutes into walking and I hear my name being called from behind and there were our friends who were going to Raasta and we tagged along.Now, never in so many pubs, clubs and bars that I have been...read more" 8893 "2014-05-31 03:44:47" 186  https://www.zomato.com/review/yexBm 1 1401488087.0

The menu uploaded here probably needs to be updated, as the menu we got was quite different. We ordered a grilled cheese sandwich (don't remember the name and it's not on the menu uploaded here) which was so different from the regular grilled cheese. The stuffing inside was very flavourful - mixed veggies, loads of melting oozy cheese, and it was grilled to perfection. This was served with a salsa, a mayo dip (extremely tasty) and banana fries (thin strips of banana, fried, but not at all oily, and tossed in spices- yummy!). All this was just for Rs. 295 + taxes, quite reasonable. Next we ordered a veg penne pasta in mixed sauce. This was also quite good.

My personal favourites are the chicken faffa, Carribean chicken strips, the Caesar salad and the pepper lamb curry bowl. The bar is well stacked and the menu boasts of all kinds of awesome concoctions. The music, again, is very true to the theme and makes sure u r in a surreal zone after a couple of drinks.The only thing to be noted is that it can get very crowded on weekends and to avoid waiting in queues, it is advisable to be there by 8ish.I would give the place a 4.5!" 8893 "2014-05-27 13:26:53" 1 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/REEgb  1401177413.0

Absolutely love the Karaoke nights, its a fun group of people that gather around and sing their hearts out.The USP is the food, its pleasing to the eye and divine when it touches your taste buds. One can feel the love that the dishes are executed with.  My personal favorite being the Calamari Rings, Chilli Prawns and Traditional American Pepperoni Pizza amongst many others.The Bar menu is extensive and one should definitely try the Electric Ice Tea to have a bomber of a night ;)p.s.

Apparently he is a big fan of the ladies.Third - The food. By some miracle I was able to find a waiter and order a mezze platter, however it turned out to be extremely average. I decided not to experiment any further.Verdict - if your idea of a good time at a bar is sweaty crowds dancing to ear splitting music ( which is a mix of anything ranging from rock n roll to trance to honey singh ), non existent customer service and a nonchalant management then yes, give it a try.

In drinks I had a white russian (i tried white russian for the first time so cant really compare, but it was good). I was actually there for live music but had to leave before it even started. Also there were no desserts (except for the cheesecake, which i had eaten the day before so i didnt order it ).Overall ambiance, service and music were awesome.BUT PLEASE DONT USE SO MUCH OIL. and I've a very sweet tooth, so please more desserts availability.hopefully will attend the live music performance next time, which i've heard is very good." 8893 "2013-10-01 16:49:04" 25 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/EMwqr 1 1380626344.0

The drinks are a little pricey but just for the sake of the good music and vibe I think I will come back again!As for the music, they usually play alot of reggae and killer dubstep. But on Sundays, they play dubstep, house, trance etc. after 9PM(the dj is talented and has a good collection!).Worth a visit, maybe more than once. :)" 8893 "2013-06-14 11:30:00" 10 Good https://www.zomato.com/review/lwZwy  1371189600.0

So many times I have gone there alone and ended up having a good time mixing and chatting with regulars or first time visitors. Karaoke on Tuesday and Ladies nights on Sunday are my favorite nights of the week wherein you can just sing along post work over a beer or dance, chat and drink up and enjoy the ending of the weekend. Unlike other places having tiny rooms or balconies as smoking areas, Raasta has a huge covered terrace making it easy to breathe and chat up. The drinks are potent esp. the LIIT.
