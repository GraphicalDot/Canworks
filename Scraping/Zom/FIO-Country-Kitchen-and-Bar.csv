Even though there were many tables available, they told us that the table we were requesting to be seated at was reserved. Guess what... No one turned up for that table even 2 hours later. They were only serving Corona and no other beer and only one forgettable red wine by the glass. The waiters were friendly and eagerly suggested drinks and food options.

Some of my favourite dishes include the broccoli cappuccino with almond flakes. It's a great soup, and healthy and delicious at the same time. The Pondicherry prawns, which can be had as a starter of a main course dish, has a strong flavour of pepper and curry leaves and is also delicious.

Yet for all the good places I have visited and reviewed ,there are subtle differences here and there but nothing really which really set them apart.With that perspective I think this place ,located a little off the MG road in a premises called Garden of Five Senses was a delightful experience.To begin with it is actually situated in a garden developed by government and so the address is not a misnomer. It is located at a some distance from busy roads and you feel detached from the routine noise.

He arranged a ""Sigdi"" for us to keep warm, since it was cold outside. Thank you so much Mr Rajender!Manager, Mr Andy was very warm and hospitble.All in all, a great place to celebrate an occassion with your loved ones.

We were amazed to see that customers were arriving till 1 Am approximately. It was not very crowded, but i guess the time was the factor then. The location, interior, ambiance n all is just perfect. We opted for an outdoor table.Our order came within 10-12 mins. Decent time according to me. The food quality was awesome. We already had snacks before going for fio, so we had little space for main course. We ordered a country lasagne, a tandoori platter don't remember its name and pasta.

Allt he dishes we ordered, Norwegian sea bass in chives and wine sauce with mash, tenderloin, grileld chicken, were served in an almost alike manner. The fish was nice but the sauce accompanying it lacked some flavour and was a bit on the over salty side. The pastry basket which they use to serve the grilled vegetables tasted a little stale.

My wife and I chose Fio for our anniversary lunch on the basis of the reviews and photographs on Zomato. It looked like a great place for a romantic lunch. We wanted an outdoor table: as on one side a birthday party was going on, we requested a table on the quieter side. We were seated and after a bit of hand waving were given a menu (one menu card for two people and only when we asked did we get the drinks menu). Then after a lot of hand waving the lady who seated us said that the place where we had been seated was a closed area (they had even given us the menu there) and we had to sit either right next to the birthday party or inside. By this time 20 mins had gone by and we were very hungry (it was nearly 3 pm). But it was an anniversary lunch after all, so we let it be and sat next to the party.

It was her birthday and she wished to go to someplace exquisite. 'Her wish was my command , at least on her birthday', I said to myself. Going by all the reviews I'd read , I boiled down on Fio.

I had to remind myself that I am in Delhi. :)Even in hot, early May we did not feel the absence of AC, as the place was aptly, well, fanned! Mosquito coils under each table ensured that we weren't bothered by them, despite the surrounding and the season.The staff is very courteous and helpful with selection of the dishes. We tried the pepperoni pizza in the main course and ""scloppine pollo e' funghi"" - a delectable chicken and mushroom stater. The portion sizes are good, except the breads, which are served in paltry. But altogether, we did not have any complaints.The choice of wine by glass is a little limited, but manageable.Overall, a must-try restaurant, especially for a date!" 4283 "2013-05-06 13:25:53" 37 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/DPmlk 2 1367826953.0

I love the concept of outdoors eating and its hard to find good places like that in Delhi. The holiday spirit also made our dining experience all the more better.Buffet was pretty lavish and the quality of ingredients was good. But, the selection left a lot to be desired. First, in the Italian section, you cannot possible have about 10 veg dishes and only 2 non-veg dishes (chicken and fish). The crowd there is cosmopolitan and a non-veg eater would really like some options, besides one chicken and fish. Then, a single pasta counter to cater the entire crowd was not sufficient.

Despite being an absolutely packed evening and customers yelling across to the servers, the staff was absolutely patient and polite. They did take time for serving the dishes, i guess because of the rush but the interaction was pleasant.I would recommend the kebabs and the pastas.

The service was prompt, efficient and very helpful, specially their restaurant manager, Mr. Akhil Gupta, who gives personal attention and is careful about details.

The service is pretty good, we had personal service all through so it was great. The staff is quick at making suggestions too.

I went there with my partner to celeberate a special occasion and it lived upto my expectation. Coming on to the food, it is good too. On my visit there i had Fritto misto di mare in appetizers which was well cooked, full of flavours. For main course i had Lasagna Con Asparagi which was really soft exactly the way a Lasagna should be cooked. For Drinks we had french wine Moulin Vent which added onto making the experience even better.

Its not dusty or hot. It has an indoor and outdoor setting. Sit indoors with the family and outdoors with the boyfriend! Its beautiful anyway.Very well done seating and lighting which is really comfortable. The music however, didn't go with it because they played loud music but that could be ignored or rather worked upon.A lavish bar but an expensive one will let you enjoy a drink or two with the food. The vegetarian kebab platter comes with a good eight kebabs which should be enough for two with maybe some Daal and Naan. Its yummy North Indian Food. The Lasagne is a chef's recommendation and is really delicious too.The service is proficient with waiters attending to you and ensuring the food and drinks are what you desired (Because I remember getting some drink altered).

Though it was hot boiling summers but temperature was intelligently maintained by mist fans. So blend of mist and lightning make it eloquent.but prices are quite high and portion of food is not adjustable with it.one can only afford it one in 3 -4 month.A normal dinner with limited order can easily hit your pocket near 2000.If you have couple of drinks then it can rise up to 4000. but i must say A MUST VISIT place for the people who to love to experiment with place and food. i will visit here soon." 4283 "2012-07-02 11:14:19" 5 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/yXRkY  1341207859.0

The place looked amazing, but the service and quality of what was on offer were both equally pathetic. I mean even at the price, everything is priced at, it could still work but then they should change a few things. First, the support staff needs to be completely revamped, that's for sure. Then, the management needs to get few things straight. For instance, they should know - You can't sell a shitty sheesha at 800 and ask the guest to pay another 200/400 just for a coal change, that's getting a little too greedy.Overall - Pathetic and exorbitantly priced." 4283 "2012-06-11 00:33:41" 1 Poor https://www.zomato.com/review/YKKAO 1 1339355021.0

But, I must say the service is quite pathetic considering it's an upscale restaurant. Also, the hookah flavor was very mild and did not seem worth the Rs. 800. Also, it does not make sense to charge Rs. 400 for a coal change. Even if it was not for free, it would have been reasonable to charge 1/4th of the original cost for hookah i.e. Rs. 200. Basically, i think if the beverages and food is priced in a higher range, it should be the priority of the restaurant to provide good service. After all, if in the scenic locale where a certain someone would choose to unwind should not be subjected to bad service and then overcharged for it.
