The mall was relatively empty at the time of day we visited and the Restaurant (that's what it looked like in the day) had not even a single customer. The decor screamed sci-fi and wasn't really appealing but who cares about decor when your a couple of drinks down right ??We moved straight to the Ice section of the 'lounge'. Nothing loungy or exceptional about this except that you experience -14 degree temperature. The windcheater overcoats are fairly okay and keep you safe from the elements.The ice sculptures are broken here and there. Not sure if it was done intentionally to give the place a natural look, however, it certainly did not look like it. There is an Ice sofa which you can sit on and enjoy your drink, however, the only area (on the sofa) where you can sit is on two bathroom type rubber mats which were placed to prevent your bottom from getting...read more" 2750 "2012-06-12 23:36:27" 10  https://www.zomato.com/review/qzzBA 1 1339524387.0

Not a total club experience cos when i went there in 2010 for x'mas the place was all crammed up and crowd was just ok. The only attraction is the ice lounge,its icy royal seats and decor. Shots being served on ice glasses, All nice and sassy. Heard the lounge was shut for renovation so don't know what are the changes now. I have been there thrice and I think its just a one time experience place. I wouldn't go there again. If it wasn't for my friends interest to go and see the ice lounge, I think there are plenty of other places to party in Delhi. So yeah i wouldn't bother coming here.I am not saying that the place is bad but I just think once you've been there done that, you wouldn't be all hyped again. Apart from that food wise its good especially chicken wings and satay. Entry charges are exorbitant and all you get is 1 drink on the house. Not worth it.Its an above average place." 2750 "2012-05-21 01:02:08" 84 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/Onro 4 1337542328.0

However, they could definitely play the music a little less louder!!There are two sections inside, one ""normal"" and the other ""ice section"", which apparently has frozen sculptures at sub-zero temperatures! The ice section has a heavy entry fee: 1400/- for 1 person for vodka n a few other drinks n no snacks/food. Me not being so fond of drinking, and a little short of time, decided to give the normal section a shot, just to sample the food.Though they claim Lebanese and continental as their specialty, somehow i couldn't take the place very seriously. So to be on the safe side, I ordered murg punjabi kebab and it looked nothing like the picture on the menu! It tasted delicious, but the quantity was too less for over 550/- incl taxes! It was my first visit to Ice lounge and may be my last!!It might appeal more to a group of 5-6 people, preferably a boisterous bunch, that can manage to be louder than the extraordinary sound levels!!" 2750 "2012-05-07 21:56:43" 112 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/wQNx 2 1336408003.0

I couldn't imagine such a place could be built in Delhi, but it did and it did so with a blast. You are surrounded with everything icy, the glasses, walls, seats, bar, sculptures, everything is made up of ice. You can even touch them and feel the chill. The best part is the costume they give you before entering, looking like an Eskimo, you enjoy the place like hell.Only a few drinks like vodka and some mocktails are served inside the main icy area. Outside there is a normal lounge, where they serve food. Spring roll and chilly paneer were delicious. Garlic bread was ok ok. The ambiance in the outside area is also very good with very very comfortable couches.Overall a must visit place for all adventure lovers who would like to try something new.Yes, this place is full of ice at -10 degree inside temperature." 2750 "2012-03-13 12:58:43" 38 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/Qdqv 2 1331623723.0
