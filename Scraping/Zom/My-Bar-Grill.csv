My main point here they cheated us by making a fraud bills. They added extra order in final bills and when we requested to them show the order slips then they show us slips which were not signed by us and said no these order were placed one of your table.

Why not My Bar we thought? After all, the outlet at Paharganj had always been a frequent destination for a friendly get-together. Managing to crawl up the three flights of steps, we were greeted by a laid back decor and a smiling waiter who assured us in broken English that a table would be ready for us while we waited outside in the balcony.In the meantime, we were given four menus for the each of us, which turned out to be surprisingly randomly selected. Only one of them was for the dishes, while the rest were only the drinks! Anyway, after what seemed like around fifteen minutes, we ourselves went inside to find a place to sit on our own as nobody bothered to inform us that quite a few empty tables were actually available. Settling down, we quickly decided on a pitcher of draught beer as the...read more" 304296 "2013-08-06 01:31:22" 2  https://www.zomato.com/review/rDpdw 1 1375732882.0

But that is the case with alot of places in hauz khaas village, and it wouldn't be fair to complain about it. When I entered the place, it was love at first sight with the atmosphere and the feel. I knew I wouldn't be leaving for a couple of hours. To start the night, I ordered a cosmopolitan, which happened to be the worst drink of my life ever.(Tip- do not go for their cocktails, you will be very very disappointed.)For food, we had ordered the regular finger foods. We had chicken wings, fish and chips and chicken satte. The service was very slow and nobody came to take our order for about half an hour. That did not bother us, we were so absorbed into enjoying the music and dancing.So what happens now?I will go there again on some Saturday night for the amazing music, the...read more" 304296 "2013-07-28 17:40:11" 6  https://www.zomato.com/review/qRkxY  1375013411.0

Good work guys! Even in its early stages this place managed to give me a night to remember! With tables on two sides there is a huge dancing space in the middle, right in front of the DJ. Give it some time! Maybe a few weeks! They still have to change the name of the place, give proper menus, proper discounts. But i'm sure by the end of August it's gonna be a major competition to all the other cafes in Hauz Khas Village. :-)" 304296 "2013-07-25 01:34:04" 1 Good https://www.zomato.com/review/zYnql 1 1374696244.0
