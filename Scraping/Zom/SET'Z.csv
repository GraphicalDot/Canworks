Placed strategically in the Emporio mall, it somehow always gives you the impression of being the only reasonably priced thing here. The brunch at about 1600-1700 is not at all bad and lavish by all standards. What I really love is the mix of so many cuisines, Indian, Mediterranean, Thai, Japanese &amp; Chinese. The dimsums served here is scrumptious, followed by their thin crust pizzas which are light and tasty. The Sushi's are nice. However it is their Indian stuff that is exemplary especially Nihari, Dum Biryani and Qormas.First Impression: A large well lit classy restaurant with an amazing buffet display.Pros: Great quality multiple cuisines at one place.Cons: Nothing major.Go &amp; visit once folks!" 3429 "2014-08-31 00:39:52" 14 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/ovvPzK  1409425792.0

The Spaghetti Arabiatta with chicken was decent but had way too much oil. The Penne Arabiatta with Ricotta was average, the tomatoes they had used to make the sauce were sour thus the pasta did not taste too good.

They have both open and closed seating. I have never seated outside so can't comment upon it. They have a huge area that can accommodate a lot of people so u would not have to wait for a seat. The tables and chairs, couches etc have been done very nicely. It is a very luxurious setting. You will see open kitchens, which add to the environment.

Service was great and the food was good too..Atmosphere was very lively..service was decent.Even they have outside seating which looked good but as it was little cold so we preferred to sit inside.They also serve Buffet lunch. Which we couldn't try as we went there in the evening but will definitely try it the next time we visit the restaurant.I really liked their decor, the restaurant has been very well designed.

Going to a high end mall such as Emporio, you expect the highest standards of service starting from meet and greet right till the very end of leaving the restaurant. This was the complete opposite the last time I dined at the restaurant. The servers were busy or acting busy despite the restaurant not even being fully occupied. We had to ask 3 times for our order to be taken. Then comes the baguette which was stale and not even edible which is absolutely unacceptable.

From Sushi to amazing roast meats to Biryani - you will find there's too much amazing food to be tried.  Added to that the liquor they include in the brunch is very good, and not the cheap stuff that is the bane of Sunday brunches at most places. The only reason I am docking one star is that it's very expensive (Sunday Brunch with alcohol is about Rs. 2600+ per person). While you certainly get your money's worth, it's just a little excessive for the average person to spend on a regular basis.

The prawns dimsums were excellent and had very good quality prawns. The california sushi rolls were not bad either. The thin-crust pepperoni pizzas were delicious and so were the Indian style lamb ribs. The desserts were pretty good too, especially the perfectly prepared pancakes with generous helpings of maple syrup!

This is a very expensive place, but I think well worth the money.  Ambience--tops,  Service---very good. Food quality--excellent. They make every effort they can to bring you an excellent dining experience. And the menu is HUGE, and high quality.----- 13 Dec, 2011 -----We've dined here twice and both times we had delicious food, well prepared in a lovely atmosphere.First time we had the Duck spring roll appetizer.  Delicious.  Second visit enjoyed the Peking Duck.

It was an acutely disappointing experience:  the two noodle dishes barely had any noodles, and the beancurd/shitake dish with dried red curry paste was over-spiced to the extent that one could barely taste the zest. The BBQ duck alone was good.  We tried Chinese and Thai dishes only, but they brought us two loaves of bread before our meal -- which would be appropriate if we had ordered Italian, Greek or Continental food.  If they wish to serve complimentary munchies, they should think of what would go with the food, especially since this is a multi-cuisine restaurant.  For all their apparent sophistication, the restaurant is clueless about such things.  The portions were small, and the restaurant seemed intent on proving the commonly held view about restaurants that veer towards pretentiousness, namely that the more expensive the restaurant, the smaller the portions.

The brunch is now really good and a great improvement upon previous times, let's say a month back.I would recommend the Sunday Brunch, especially the continental salad bar, the BBQ grill and the Chinese food. The mutton biryani is also pretty good. All in all a good draw for continental cuisine.Ofcourse on another side, they have one of the neatest and most well maintained toilets.The brand is ""Toto"" imported from Japan. However there's too much of snobbishness and the female waitresses tend to throw a lot of attitude.
