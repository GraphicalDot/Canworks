The service quality at the entrance is very poor and i was shocked to see that the entry fees vary from person to person since the employees at the gate are busy pleasing their biases. I wonder what the entry rules are (if any). Also i would like to know how much the entry fees is (since it varies from person to person).

That was really rude and unwillingly I had to give it off to her until the manager stepped up and apologised for her behaviour and said they do not allow any eatables. It was a shame to the club.

The Victorian glass chandeliers and beautiful red wall lights were adding to the magnanimity of the place.The sound system was out of the world and had the constant thump. The music was flawless the perfect blend of commercial and bollywood kept the night going on and on.Prices as expected were high for drinks. A pint of kingfisher ultra for Rs 500.

The club has kept a high security for the people !! The security kept checking on highly drunk guys !! I was a little disappointed with the music ... It was nice but The music was not as good as it should be ! The interiors were good ... They had a very reddish black feel to the club ... !

After all what do I expect when I go to a five hotel to a party place which is as it is famous for being the rich mans club. I don't agree with the people who have written that its very expensive and they got a shock after seeing the bill. However, my problem really is that I don't like discrimination for rights of admission. When I came to the entrance, I met an acquaintance who was standing for half an hour and did not get in. After that I met a friend who was also returning. I was lucky enough to enter and I saw that the club was not packed. It wasn't empty but there was a lot of room. So I want to tell the management to have a heart and treat people with respect because they are coming dressed from home to your club, to spend money on inflated priced drinks and you cant turn them down.In essence, the service was great.

The interiors are nicely done, with red and black throwing up a great vibe. The couches are comfy and spacious for small groups and couples. There isn't much space to be honest, and you feel that the central row seating is the culprit. The row seems a forced introduction to cater to the typical Indian seating trend, and robs you of some very amazing dance / chill space. You effectively, if you're dancing in a group, you can't really do that without putting your rear in someone else's face or vice-versa.The drinks are good, and as expected fast. Had a few shots and cocktails, and they were all shot up.The music is good, with the modern electro being the preferred gene.
