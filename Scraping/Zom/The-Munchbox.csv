My cousin and I ordered Mac n Cheese, The All American Sub and the Crispy Chicken Burger. And the prices aren't too heavy on the pocket. We were impressed that the delivery was done under twenty minutes and the packaging was so neat and cute! The Mac n Cheese was a little disappointing since it turned out to be the fried kind but the American Sub compensated for it. Mouth-watering amounts of cheddar and ham led us straight to food paradise.

We got a lot of boxes for the amount of food we ordered (read inefficient packaging).The burger was decent, but left room for more to be desired. The fries were weird and small. When we asked before placing our order if the portion was big enough for 1, we got assured that since the burger was accompanied with fries and coleslaw, it'd be plenty. Which was not the case at all. The portions for both the fries and the coleslaw were ridiculously small. I wouldn't have minded if they bumped up the price a bit but made sure that the portion was more filling.The roast chicken itself was split into 2 boxes (2 pieces) and 1 more box for the mashed potatoes and the veggies.

(Such foresight. Much wow.) The All American Sub even had a tiny container dainitly labelled 'Roasted Sauce' with it!Plus, the best part is that they deliver LATE into the night...so when your hungry, drunk friend shows up at your doorstep unannounced at 12.30 at night, you know where you can order from!Overall, highly recommended." 308196 "2014-08-28 12:56:06" 28 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/AKNXLZ 7 1409210766.0

There's just the right amount of cream and flavourful herbs as topping. It comes with a sour cream that compliments it really well. And considered the quantity of the potatoes (pretty big) they are quite generous with the bacon strips!The Lebanese platter was actually one of the best platters I've had.

Munchbox is responsible for me sleeping on an empty stomach today.Firstly, when i ordered the person on the other end explained to me very patiently that they did not have much beverage choice today and finally I ordered the only choice available, a cold drink.The delivery boy lost his way at 3:00 am in the morning and delivered to me at around 3:40 am. I live approximately 1.5 kms from their outlet and a delivery time of 10 mins was more than sufficient given that it was 3 in the morning.I was angry but, hunger had made me overlook the late delivery. But, SUPRISE!!!Now, the person taking the order had forgotten all about the cold drink.This was just not making sense to me now. I called the management and they promised me a cold drink would be at my doorstep in 5 minutes. Well, it arrived at 4 am .A total response time of approximately 80-90 minutes from taking the order to reaching my doorstep was just...read more" 308196 "2014-07-29 04:29:51" 2  https://www.zomato.com/review/POxzN 1 1406588391.0

You want the the tastiest food at the oddest time.. Because that's when you are eating to actually satiate your cravings.. And Munchbox gives you exactly that. Bored, rather not satisfied with all the other late night deliveries sprouting up in the city, we decided to give this new place a try. Going by their impressive menu, we genuinely hoped for the food to be good. We ordered the chikonara pasta, Moroccan lamb, garlic bread with cheese, malai tikka roll ( which stood out from the million other rolls served all across the city) and the chicken and grape salad. Verdict- it was all sooo good!!! With their pasta and salad menu, I don't think I will go to big chill anymore, and that's a big decision.Great going Munchbox!!!

Another point added to the given 5 pointer is prawns . it simple make ur taste buds dance .Another thing i like about this place is the service seems to be really quick. and they take a feedback survey on the phone too .something i surely recommend to all the foodies out there is the combination of salads they give, it not only attract u to call this box again but rather look for the recipe as well cuz it was simple amazing. the chicken and grape salad seems to be perfectly mixed.Perfect value for money , keep the good work champs." 308196 "2014-07-24 15:59:48" 25 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/Xxgor 5 1406197788.0

Jumbo burger is ""Truly Jumbo"", and the shoe string fries was a new experience all together. I am not sure if I should say, I got a complimentary pasta salad too. Why I won't give it a 5? Because there are places for improvement. Burger started getting boring a few bites in and could have used skinnier breads. Coleslaw and pasta salad can use a finer touch.Update: Ordered pasta and fish n chips couple of nights ago. Best I have had so far.

It was so well prepared, and loaded with so much. The flavours were exactly how I wanted them to be. The bread was fresh.2) fish and chips: When u order something fried for delivery , the food usually gets a bit soggy. HOWEVER, I was amazed to find that the fish was crisp and hot, just how it is suppose to be.Crisp from outside and soft  from inside.How did it happen?I called them back, the guy at the phone took some time off his busy schedule and explained me how it remains so crisp even at our doorstep.Impressive..!!3) cottage cheese in Mexican rice with bbq sauce: Big name, big price, but biggest is the taste.

They don't just boast of a fancy menu but deliver amazingly fancy food too. I along with my friend ordered for fish &amp; chips, jumbo lamb burger &amp; zarba spaghetti. My only concern was for the fish to become soggy after a while, the first bite's cracking sound proved that they know how to deliver it fresh. Started with the fish &amp; chips which of course tasted like it was served to me in California's fish specialty restaurant. Served with the usual tartar sauce. Good portion.
