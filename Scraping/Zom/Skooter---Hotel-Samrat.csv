So we decided to go there on sat night.. We were two couples and the cover charge they have for a couple was 4k.. We went inside and noticed that they get a very mixed crowd.. People of all ages were there.. The music Dj was playing was good but after half an hour he started mixing up the music with punjabi and Bollywood songs... We were not drunk at all so for the first drink me n my lady friend asked for vodka with orange juice and the guys had their whiskey on the rocks.. Trust me it was tasting as tho there were no vodka in there.. All I could taste was orange juice.. Anyways after that we decided to have only tequila shots.. Also we ordered one hookah.. Hookah was nicely done and was good... They closed the party at 1 am. This place is good to be if U don't much options.

The brief music we heard was good, but it was overcrowded, pretentious and people just seemed to be there to be seen. We had to argue to get our money back as they should have stopped letting people in after a certain point- especially when they knew the cops would be closing.
