Took seat in interior side of the restaurant. The ambiance is a reflection of an Italian cafe as the interiors are really international. With lit lamps and soft jive being played in background Olive is a romantic and date place . As the weather outside got darker the light in the lamps grew and this place got so comforting.  The waiters wear a funny printed shirt and are really smiling and so helpful. We ordered a charizo and pepperoni pizza which was massive in size and could surely serve more than 2 . And for desserts we ordered pave of chocolate ganache.  The dessert was a disappointment as I've read about it in reviews but it dint meat my expectations of being great.

I used to be a regular there with my friend Saby being at the helm of things .The place looked a bit damped maybe cause I went in early around 7 PM . The road outside was completely decimated.None the less my favourites have been their pizzas , beef burger and the rissotto .The pizza base was light and the Parma was perfect . The beef burger was a bit dry and lacked the juiciness which it was always associated with .

The staff here is very efficient, friendly &amp; very much aware of what they are serving. The ambience here is very romantic and relaxing. Would advice to try to get seated outdoors(even in summers they have well placed fans so you won't feel the heat). The non veg mezze platter is a must have. Chicken espatada is a very good starter, love the presentation. Spicy chicken pizza &amp; pepperoni pizza are fabulous. The Pepperoni pizza is one of the best you will ever have.

From sun-kissed Long Island Ice Teas to a chilled beer, its a place to hang out with friends. The food is definitely good. The Moroccon chicken, which was part of a buffet, we had, was indeed very tasty. The hummus and baba ganoush was also nice. The saffron rice as a standalone item was tasty. And then the desserts came. While the cheesecake actually tasted like cheese, it was the ugly looking blob of chocolate that gets my thumbs up. Its heavenly, melt in the mouth, which can transport you to a parallel universe. Indeed, looks can be deceiving. Right from the place to the food, its a new wine packed in an old looking bottle....read more" 3258 "2014-05-16 18:30:18" 7  https://www.zomato.com/review/laNKn  1400245218.0

I can imagine bringing visitor here after an excursion there. We were greeted at the entrance and shown to our table quickly.  There is a beautiful garden courtyard which will be lovely in cooler weather but we chose to sit inside. Unfortunately we were sat at a table where there were a few too many mosquitoes and bugs buzzing around for my liking. I did choose to grin and bear it but it detracted a little from a generally pleasant lunch.The menu is decidedly Mediterranean with numerous choices for veg and non-veg eaters. For starters, my dining companion and I shared a vegetarian mezze platter. It came in a towering contraption and had hummus, beetroot dip, baba gaoush (aubergine dip), tzatziki, harissa, falafel, tabouleh, fatoush, croquette and pita bread.

The martinis this place have are also the best - no one can have just one *ting ting*. Jokes apart, this is a stunning restaurant. I think when a Chef shows off his/her talent he/she makes a souffle and the Goat's Cheese Souffle at Olive is to die for.The Pizzas are good too. I have surely had better but if you like pizza and you happen to be at Olive, you will not regret ordering one. Foie gras which is made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been specially fattened, was exquisite. It is an absolute must have - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.The location is to die for, I mean right in the shade of the Qutub Minar what could be better and the view is best enjoyed with grilled mushrooms and wine. The service was absolutely glitch free.Regards,MayankTEAM SHIVANGI REVIEWSLIKE US ON Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/shivangireviews &amp; spread the joy!! :)Leave your comments:...read more" 3258 "2013-12-29 22:34:32" 452  https://www.zomato.com/review/BwDyD 21 1388336672.0

If that is not the case, the service levels must be good enough to justify the pricing.Since I went here some time back it would be unfair to judge the food but what I do remember is waiting patiently for our order to arrive, which took more than 30 minutes or so to arrive.We were offered complimentary breads as our order took forever to arrive and the waiter even once brought in the wrong pizza with mushrooms despite a special repeated request to not have any mushrooms added.Trouble is with good ambiance and a terrific idea to open up a restaurant, you can't do away by hiring run of the mill servers who can't/don't understand your order.The pizza was good but since I'm not a fan of the wafer like crusts it's safe to assume my review towards the food would be biased.

In fact it was too dark to read the menu, had to use our mobile phones for the light. My husband burnt his fingers with the flying glass and the candle on the table also went in the food. All they said was sorry and gave us free ice-cream. It could have been a bad accident as the glass just flew all over.The place is really nice, food is over priced and bad service on drinks and food." 3258 "2012-05-09 15:26:21" 1 Poor https://www.zomato.com/review/YQpO  1336557381.0

The ambiance is absolutely lovely and the food is good too. Be prepared to have a long dinner as the pace of the service is leisurely, so not a place to 'eat and run'.If you are going for the first time, try and get a table outside if you are willing to brave the cold in winters. Also be sure to try the seafood risotto, it is delicious! The pizzas are also great here." 3258 "2012-01-23 10:27:33" 4 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/kkYG 1 1327294653.0

(No matter that most only turn up around lunch time, and then spiritedly chat over copious wine - it must always be called brunch. And lazy.)The six of us - the wife and I, another couple, and our one 4 year old daughter each - walked past the whitewashed walls through the tree studded white gravel courtyard, initially thankful that we did not get reservations at any of the courtyard tables on this cold, weakly lit afternoon. But as we walked through to our table indoors, past the gas fires and coals smouldering in the 'karhais', we realised that outdoors would have been cosy enough. Unfortunately, a 'private party booking' in the courtyard put paid to those thoughts.Once inside, the wine was quickly served (the kids...read more" 3258 "2011-11-04 15:51:55" 2  https://www.zomato.com/review/qBmY 1 1320402115.0

We tried the wood oven pizzas which were a let down but the pasta very well made up for it, specially the bowl of olive oil mixed with different herbs that they give along with it.  Meal for two without drinks would approximately cost around 2000 INR.Definitely a must visit for Italian food lovers." 3258 "2011-08-19 19:12:46" 1 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/zLBn  1313761366.0
