You will find families eatin here inside their cars or a group of iit'ians who come here to satisfy their tastebuds and of course those people who just bought their alcohol from the next shop and need something to eat with their drinks.All said the best part about this place is the quick service and cheap prices and the consistency in the taste of the food.

The heavenly galauti kebabs..are soo soft that they just dissolve in your mouth right away! Kalmi kebabs are excellent in flavour! Juicy and succulent enough! Chicken satey would not disappoint anyday!! I can gulp it all over in one go! Mutton seekh kebab and chicken seekh kebab.. Are great as well! In the main course we prefer eating kadhai chicken (generally) which is spicy and so delectable in taste.. Just the way I love!!Food-5/5Service -5/5Value for money- 5/5I won't rate the ambiance ..

Over the years, it has grown, and how. Now in the very same market, it has 3 restaurants, all serving different segments- a dhaba, a normal restaurant and a fine-dining restaurant. But the dhaba is still my favourite. Rajinder's is most famous for its fish fry and its tandoori chicken, which are both spectacular. But all its other dishes are really good too. Among starters, I really enjoy the mutton seekh kebabs (which are really juicy), chicken satay, mutton galauti (nothing compared to Tunday Kebabi at Lucknow but quite good by Delhi standards), afghani chicken, malai tikka and their rolls. Among the gravy items, their chicken curry is a must-try item, and a welcome change from the butter chicken we normally end up having everywhere (though the butter chicken here is also really good).

In fact my dad tells me the Dhaba has been around for way more than 25 years.The non-vegetarian food is one of the best in the city in its own way. A lot of things (like their Seekh Kababs) have their own flavor, subtly quite different to what you generally find for those names. But it is amazing stuff. Personal recommendations would be their Chicken Gravy/Curry (Do NOT take Butter Chicken here, try the normal curry!), Tandoori/Fried Seekh Kababs, Fried Fish, Chicken Tikka and the normal Naan. You won't be disappointed by any of these if you're into (very) spicy, thick, rich and well cooked non vegetarian food. Do try the mutton Galauti kababs too.It is not a Dhaba anymore but it is still mostly take away (unless you sit in the AC section). But purely on the food (and the incredible value for money) I'd give it 4.5/5.

Things must be more peaceful in the restaurant. they have a few tables spread in a shack like place to have the food outdoors. We decided to have there since its cheaper than the menu in the restaurant.The chicken curry and the non veg platter is the biggest hit in our dinner. Chicken curry had a very special uncommon flavour. Highly recommended. the kebabs and chicken grills were also good. All this made our butter chicken taste 'just normal'.Overall it was a really good experience. Good quantity and taste for the money. Value for money guaranteed.

You order at the payment counter, and hand over your receipt to this frantic guy manning the cooks. It is an old styled cookery with open barbecues and an open kitchen, where the cooks tirelessly prepare fresh stuff. We ordered Afghani Chicken, Chicken Satay and Paneer Tikka. Being a hardcore chicketarian, the chicken items were real delicacies, especially the Satay. Served on a little stick, it was well cooked and delightfully spicy. We got a good quantity of Afghani Chicken, again a wonderful dish. My vegetarian friend was apparently satisfied with the Paneer Tikka.

This eating joint has kept the tradition of serving tasty non-veg food @ easy going price. I love their chicken satey, galauti kabab although this item can be bit spicy, tasty butter chicken, regular chicken curry which is again bit spicy. They also serve mouth watering tikkas, pick any and you wont be disappointed. Veg lovers will be disapointed. Steer clear from their biryani section as it pathetic. Stick to regular breads like roomali roti and nan, other bread offerings are not good. Almost once every weekend i stop by to have dinner here on my way back home.

Go and find out the reason for yourself because reviews don't do justice to the quality of the meat and their traditional, delicious preparation. Only reason it looses a star for me is lack of spice and inconsistency of quality from day to day.Food:People say they have the best Murg Makhni in town... I think that is a stretch but its definitely damn good. Better than Moti Mahals, not as good as Kareems. Other than that the mutton burra and other chicken and mutton dishes all hold up on their own and can make for a great meal. The Tandoori selections are my favorite.Rajinder's is our goto Friday lunch spot for work and what I've found after a year of going is there is a wild amount of quality inconsistencies. So if you have a bad experience its worth a second try because it could be completely different.

We were seated immediately at a table of our choice and handed the menu cards. The regulars  who were accompanying me had already decided what they wanted to eat, but it took 20 mins and multiple requests from our end to get the servers to take our order. Sadly they were out of dahi ke kebab and  galauti kebabs. We therefore ended up ordering just the fish fry, which I am told was good. We followed this with a kadhai paneer (large in portion and good in taste), a butter chicken (great too) and lachcha paranthas (buttery and well done).

Its awesome.The food is nice n service is real quick. It was all piping hot.I must say the prices were not the typical dhaba type as i expected but it was still value for money based on the taste i got.Service guys are a bit dhaba style too.This place runs for food and non vegetarians will surely wanna go again n again.Just reach before time as it gets really difficult to wait outside with all the great kababs smelling.Do try chicken afghani...

Everyone was hungry and in the mood for a hearty meal but not too ready to brave the heat out, so we ordered in.The food arrived and our collective hopes were dashed. The Chicken Seekh Kabab was drier than what we were used to and quite bland. Its mutton counterpart was better, but only marginally so.

And the way I categorize my preferences for restaurants, Rajinder Da Dhaba is without a doubt a brand name for me.This place is definitely not for fine dining.

It has the over powering reeking smell of chicken. But the food brilliant is no doubt.The chicken in its sheer variety is a treat for all.  The pieces of succulent meat melt in your mouth.  The service is quick and its VFM. I have enjoyed the Chicken Malai Tikka, Chicken Afghani, Fish Tikka and Tawa Mutton dishes. Each time it has been brilliant to say the least. The tastes are distinct for each and the masalas used for each dish has seeped into the tender pieces of meat. Each bite into the meat has you begging for more. Its one of those places I would keep visiting each time." 1777 "2012-06-02 11:56:05" 66 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/mLLZ 2 1338618365.0

The place is a take away and is always crowded and bustling with people from families to pickling away in cars parked on the road.The food is nothing short of excellent, the kebabs, I tried Galawati, Afghani and tandoori are succulent and consistent on the taste. The gravy items, I tried the butter chicken, which was unlike the usual sweet red gravy, this one was a thick spicy gravy and worth the money you pay for it.The rolls, I tried the mutton seek and chicken tikka rolls are worth rolling in happiness for.Hits the spot!

They jus keep expanding and don't let customers get bored with the monotonous  menu. Every item in the menu is to die for but my personal fav is their Tawa chicken with makhan naan which they make right in front of you.The tikkas can be carried to your cars and can be enjoyed with your drinks which are also available in the same vicinity (Govt liquor Shops).This is the place where bachelors come to take off the steam after work or those who are just too lazy to cook and are in a mood of a cheap delicacy.Its certainly the best and totally awesome!!" 1777 "2012-03-01 15:12:32" 20 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/LXeK 2 1330594952.0
