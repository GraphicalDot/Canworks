We reached at around 8, left our car with the valet and asked for our table to one of the staff there. We wanted to sit out and we could also see a number of empty tables but the staff said that all these are reserved. The server checked whether our name was in the reservation list and then started looking for a table for us. In the meantime we got hold of Sanchit and he took us inside.

My first thoughts on the place we're ranging around a rating of 2.5 but as soon as I stepped in the outdoor sitting I was astonished. It was amazing, much better than the indoor sitting. The mist cooling system really amazed me. How cooling it was in this hot Delhi weather, that is the factor that got my rating up to a 4. Anybody who likes good hookah and good sitting (outdoors) to go with it I would suggest this as an amazing chill out location. Not recommended for dates, but group chillouts are highly encouraged.

Located at Nehru Place,  The Flying Saucer Cafe is doing brisk business.  The food and drinks menu is excellent.  Despite the house full service was quick.  There are two bars to cater to large crowds , a big one inside and a small one outdoors.  A great place to catch up with friends for some good times.

Had gone with a few friends visiting from UK &amp; after about 30 minutes of being there, I was regretting that we left comfortable seating, good music, drinks, food &amp; crowd at the S Bar (Shalom) and ventured here for a nightcap.To begin with, I had to spend 20 minutes to figure out where to park, finally one of the guards mentioned that FS provides valet service...wasn't noticeable when I drove past initially. Handing over my car to the valet was the first mistake I made that night.As we entered, there was no seating available...it happens in good places as they get busy on Sat, so not an issue. We managed to find a waiter, who served us our drinks, which were below average. LIIT was too sweet &amp; the proportion of liquor was definitely off...probably less than what it's supposed to be.

It was jam packed especially the inner lounge cum bar (that's where gigs happen), so obviously we couldn't manage a table or seating and it was fine.The only sad part was they won't serve any food until you grab a table. Reason - you might eat and walk off without paying. Well - that's irrational to me. If that's the situation which I am sure most nice clubs would face, you can charge the customer first and then take the order. That's what happened when I went to Raasta last week. I am sure that's what happens at many other places, else don't entertain people if you can't serve them. I even offered to pay upfront but the servers were not interested and that was upsetting.

However, once we reached Epicuria in Nehru Place, we selected this joint simply because of it's more casual looking atmosphere (FIO will have to wait till some other day, I guess). We went down the steps of the landscaped lawn, and at the entrance we were greeted by their manager Mr. Dinesh who escorted us around trying to identify a good place to sit.

Last time I was here was for a book reading session my Book Club had organized at the Chatter House, which is more of an English Pub. I reached Nehru Place expecting a similar set up, but was surprised at the extravagance of the Flying Saucer.They have a separate entrance so you don't need to park in the basement.

The dips in the platter were barely about a teaspoon each and when we asked if we could get some more they said it would be charged for.

Fortunately NO extra charge was levied for extra coal.The dishes, the Barbecue chicken wings, probably the worst i have ever had ( Trust me, not exaggerating at all).The dish was served COLD and HARDLY had any Barbecue sauce or rather HARDLY any taste it. When we complained,  the dish was just heated and reserved.The Second dish, we order was the veg Mezze platter and ended up being served the The Assorted Bruschetta Mini platter.

So i decided to take on them one by one the first being The Flying Saucer Cafe.As i entered the place i found the place to be huge. It has seating both inside and outside. The interiors were really nicely done, i particularly liked the yellow lights that hung from the roof. The seating was comfortable and was arranged in a nice fashion as to allow you to reserve a section for a private get together.Moving on to the food part I ordered a crumbed mushroom, a veg mezze platter, veg penne arrabiata. The crumbed mushroom was delicious, a must try. The mezze platter was also tasty especially the falafel. As i'm a big time big chill cafe lover so i did'nt find the pasta up to the mark.

First thoughts when I entered:OMG this is such a huge place, but only 3 tables occupied !!After getting seated, no staff member seemed to care about serving water or providing food/drink menu.Honestly, the best part of their menu is the cocktails/mixes. We ordered lynchberg lemonade with lavender n cinnamon: really nice. Bruschetta's platter was also ordered, but I was shocked to see a very small portion size. The mediterranean veg. Focassia is recommended.Our turnoff point was water being served in dirty glasses.Overall i would say, not that amazing experience.

Given that it was trending and the rave reviews, I was expecting it to be great.It's located within Epicuria, which is a great gastronomical spot. Flying saucer occupies huge space within Epicuria and it is done up well and exudes a warm vibe, given the wooden furniture and floor and the amber lighting. The tables and chairs are high and not the most comfortable. Each table gets a personal server, making the service warm and attentive.We went on a Saturday night and both the indoor and outdoor sections were packed. This probably took a toll on the taste of the food, atleast that will be better than the fact that food is not great in general.

To which after checking, we were told that it was not possible to give happy hour on wine. We also tried to see if any other option was available for wine by glass, which was not available. So we suggest you should have some more variety on wine. After a few minutes we were told that the bacardi black was not available.

The place had an occupancy of 60% but a lot of good seats were reserved!We managed to find a place and ordered a NV Mezze Platter, a Sheesha and some cocktails.The table was too small to accommodate everything at the same time! Mezze platter was waste of money and cocktails were just OK, nothing compared to what one gets at TGIF, at a better price.Above all, the place had too loud music for a cafe. Expected better music and food.The ambience was good, if you leave the music bit.Don't think I will come back again.

Firstly, the decor is impressive-it has a Mediterranean chic to it unlike other restaurants in Delhi.  The staff is pretty friendly as well and accommodating.  The layout of the restaurant is perfect-chairs and couches for lounging or eating with an open bar for those interested in drinking.  The hookah itself was so so, but the food was quite good.  The prices were reasonable too for the portion sizes.  I had the veggie focaccia sandwich, which was delicious-the bread itself was full of flavor and filling.  The burgers are cooked quite well too.  I would definitely come back for any occasion." 304299 "2013-11-19 15:35:19" 109 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/PBPqo 5 1384855519.0

Possibly the best Cafe in Town!!Without a shadow of a doubt, this was a once in a lifetime experience! I came here last thursday to celebrate a 1 month anniversary. It might sound crazy to come here on a 1 month date, but it was somewhere we both really wanted to experience since we both never been. I don't think anyone can quite explain the experience, but I will try to do my best!I enjoy foodie restaurants as does my date, so this was the perfect place to go after having eaten at multiple other places and not necessarily being in a huge rush to repeat the dinner. I had previously thought Nando's was the best meal of my life a week before that, but that quickly changed by about the third course at The Flying Saucer Cafe.The service trumps any restaurant I've ever been to.

I was really impressed by their super courteous service [4.5/5]. Believe me there was sill at least 10 ml of drink left in everyone's glass before the server came and politely asked if everyone wants to repeat their drinks.

The place is huge and will be a hit during winters as it provides outdoor seating.
