There's a difference between Delhi and Bombay restaurants that I noticed in my last visit to the capital. Delhi as quite similar number if restaurants as of Bombay, however, the one thing the northern counterpart lacks is the 'quintessential quality' of the food and service . One can easily get away with it in Delhi. However, in Bombay, restaurants shut down quickly if they are not up to the standards. And  they are quickly replaced by some new fancy outposts. People lookout for quality food with ambience. Maybe, that's the reason behind Bombay having more Michelin starred restaurants while Delhi boasts different cuisines serving joints. Sadly my Brazilian fish wasn't up to the mark nor some fancy South African Chicken was well prepared." 303095 "2014-08-22 15:17:31" 32 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/KPKmRE  1408700851.0

Like rest of the major eating joints in Hauz Khas Mia Bella was no less in creative interiors, interesting lights and vintage look and feel. It is spread across 3 levels, ground, first and second floor. Ground floor is entirely inside seating whereas the first and second floor has outdoor seating as well. I visited that place in the month of May, though it was evening yet pretty humid and hot. I wanted to sit outside and so we straight went to the second floor.Though they have tried their level best to make it as cool as possible by installing water sprays. The food was nice, good in taste and good in quantity as well. The service was good, it was quite dark there so after handing over the menu card they also gave a torch to look through the menu which was very thoughtful. You will get the direct view of the hauz khas lake from there.The place was value for money and yet creative and...read more" 303095 "2014-07-08 11:10:14" 11  https://www.zomato.com/review/wegeK  1404798014.0

This place scores for it location - the cool wind from the lake and the starry skies in the night. Ample of sitting space for smokers. A lot of thought has been put into its design and it reflects the relaxed mood needed for a night away from our urbane obligations.The drinks are great, the menu diverse and well cooked, well served and simply yum.

Hmmm sorry ""Mia not gonna pay that much for it u know""It's sad u have to write a review around prices cos the food is actually good. Just not awesome enough for what they think it should be charged at....That said their fresh lime is amazing. Zingy and spiced with rock salt. Yumminess!

The ambiance was just perfect for a romantic evening but it isn't enough to make me happy. I expected a lot from this place looking at the crowd and even the menu. First of all, the servers weren't very attentive. The music was a tad bit loud for a romantic place like Mia Bella. We ordered a pepper grilled mushroom which was just okay, nothing great. It had a a lot of pepper which was making it hard for us to eat. We also ordered a Jamaican Jerk Chicken which was just appalling.In short totally disappointed with the food and the service. It wasn't worth the hype or the money.  I won't visit this place again.

When we complained about chicken, the manager promptly took it back and returned with the remaining pieces of chicken all warmed up, remaining hummus was scraped into a fresh bowl.

The management emphasizes so much on service, ambience, reviews, decor, themes, designs and so many other things that they forget the most fundamental of things - FOOD. Mia Bella is a big big example. I remember ordering black white pepper mushroom and a non veg platter. The mushrooms were pathetic and the non veg platter was also on the same lines of an utter disappointment. With too much black pepper and a completely bland taste and a completely tasteless chicken it was a combination for an instant appetite killer.I do wanna point out though that the manager did replace my order and did get the chef to meet me and personally address to my problem but it hardly made a difference even after he brought it back.

This took us around 20 mins.The pizza was unbelievably bland and sort of cold. The platter had 4 pieces of chicken wings which were so rotten that I almost vomited for which I was given 4 pieces of bland paneer tikka as a replacement. The nachos in the platter were simply some doritos and the third item being bland fried cottage cheese.In all the service was below average at best. And the food in my opinion very poor.

So my suggestion would be to not have high expectations from this place when it comes to your eating pleasures.

The place is located on the third floor and is accessable via a muscle-numbing flight of stairs. Ladies in high-heels need to be cautious while getting down the unlit stairs. Once you reach the third floor (or terrace above it), you'll know the effort was worthwhile. We chose the terrace (fourth level) and were rewarded with a breath-taking view of the Hauz and it's surrounding greenery. Indoors, rustic wood furniture is casually strewn across the place. The casual decor and warn lighting add to the overall ambiance and theme of the place, while the speakers played peppy Italian hits.Attentive servers hovered discreetly in the background, ready to help if called upon.

The rooftop is the perfect place to sit and watch the sunset and enjoy the cool evening breeze. Despite being a weekend, they were offering 1+1 on beers, the only sad part is that they had limited options and no strong beers! I think they should add more brands to their list. After about 10 odd beers, we hopped to another place in quest for strong beer. So need to go there again to try the food, considering they're marketing the place as a ""Gastropub"". But overall, an excellent place to hangout.It is clearly evident that owners/management have worked hard over the place. Even minute details have been taken care, that too in the most artistic and eclectic way. I was amazed to see that the walls of the rest-rooms had pages of an old novel all over it.
