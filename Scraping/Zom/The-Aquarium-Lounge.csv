Both were good but little too spicy, you should probably advise to make it non spicy because otherwise it kind of hide the real taste of the dish.As drinks I took a Tiki Mocktail, veray nice and refreshing.This restaurant is a good value for the price (quite cheap) and nice design with lot of food options (Mexican, Italian, Thai...)" 307273 "2014-05-25 10:04:00" 1 Good https://www.zomato.com/review/ygkZv  1400992440.0

Then this unique colour changing signage diverted me towards aquarium! The noise was actually from there. Generated my curiosity to  check the place out. The name is quiet unique, reminds me of Dubai! After talking to the manager I realised that they have opened just a week ago. It was quiet a unique design, hats off to the designer!!! The place was quiet full, usually it takes time for a new place to come up! May be it was because of India Pakistan match. I finally managed to find a cosy couch to sit on, right in front of the television. Ordered for a beer and pesto chicken skewers.

On our table we ordered about 3 different smoothies and one iced tea, and while the iced tea was decent, it lay forgotten after everyone had gotten a taste of the smoothies.. we ended up calling for another round... simply yummy....My friends and I wanted to make the best of the weather outside while it was still cool enough to sit out, and we loved the balcony area.All in all...
