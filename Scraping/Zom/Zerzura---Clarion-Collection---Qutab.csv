As long as you are seated outdoors and are not too fussy about the food, i am sure that u will enjoy the experience.                The music played here is good, the dj started playing pure bollywood after midnight. By which time you are so drunk that you don't notice that baby doll is being played every 10 min.On a serious note, was not too impressed by the belly dancers who kept making an appearance for abt 5 min after ever hour.

We ordered mezze platter (the platter is not enough for even a single one of us) , a pizza (okayish) and a veg burgerish kinda thing (bad) i guess(one of us was veg) and a drink each (shot). The ambiance is good , the place is lively. Our bill for this was about 6k. it would have easily crossed 15k if we had ordered mains and a couple of more drinks and would be still leaving hungry.Its a good place to party but not to fill your stomach ;)" 301045 "2013-07-07 17:59:43" 12 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/OMLYM 1 1373200183.0

As with all the new places and clubs that come up in Delhi, this too has its share of hype and has reasons to have that.Me and 5 of my friends went here last night and reserved a table well in advance which proved to be quite useful as later there were quite a few people outside trying to find their way in. As the name suggests, they serve a mix of Mediterranean, Moroccan and also some stuff Italian cuisine.Ambience: This has come up right where the Coffee shop used to be and It has been done up on a good scale. The interiors are appealing especially the Middle eastern inspired wooden carved decor is sure to catch the attention of one and all. The area near the dancing floor and bar is good but nothing fancy, the seating with all the long...read more" 301045 "2013-06-23 23:44:35" 334  https://www.zomato.com/review/LPdMb 2 1372011275.0

The ambience of the place will give you middle eastern feel. Amazing food... The cold mezzes are outstanding- i am in love with their dips. Order a Mezze Platter according to your preference of veg and non veg and you can taste all most all their dips with freshly baked pita breads.I Had a gala time there and plan to visit the place soon again." 301045 "2013-05-28 14:13:31" 2 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/PwbyK  1369730611.0

Great Ambiance, very good service, decent music, amazing decor and brilliant food. That's all that you'd need when you intend to dine out with friends and family. We got there accidentally but did not want to leave till the time we tried their food. The inviting factors were everything above and the menu price itself!They have wooden fireplace for baking pizza and breads, that is, perhaps first in Delhi. The service is also fine, alcohol maybe on the higher side but you can always try the ever reliable Beer.We tried their Lebanese and Turkish cuisines, both veg and non-veg and they were all amazing. The sauces, the khus-khus, spices everything was perfect.We had a gala time, hope you guys will try soon!" 301045 "2013-02-21 18:41:36" 40 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/QPrzy 1 1361452296.0
