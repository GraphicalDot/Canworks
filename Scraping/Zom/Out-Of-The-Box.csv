Good use of wood, thick ropes and bricks. We were there for a very short time and enjoyed couple of beers. I wanted to try their dishes but somehow couldn't.

The ambiance is nice but can't compensate for food. The beers tasted nice though, quite understandable those are not made at out of the box. Certainly a place to visit when you are catching up with friends over the drinks. Rooftop section lacks fans or coolers and even the provision to cover in case of rains. Menu mentioned too many things with the explanation but dont match the dishes you get on to your table with what you read in menu you will be disappointed.

It comes from the power house restaurateur Priyank Sukhija who has opened many excellent cafes and changed the Delhi Restaurant Scenario.With its casual vibe and embracing attitude, you instantly want to be inside. Located on 4th floor with a lakeside and qila view, you feel like spending a lot of time here.

The LED lights brightened up the place, which frankly I felt was a bit dull because of lack of ambient light. The seating were impressive, especially the White intervening strips of fabric all over the chairs and seating stools.The open bar did not really add any value, except for the wire-cage lanterns and balloons under the hut-shaped structure.

Be careful, before you know it you've downed three before the entrees arrive.They carry their own flavor, not just a boring vodka and soda but drinks with creative ingredients that make you wanting to try them all. Again, careful! Once the food arrived it was obvious that much thought was put into creating them. The presentations were rustic and simple but the flavors were deep and impressing.The seasoning on their Lamb Kibbeh is superb. Along with wonderful non veggie sides, try the krapao you won't regret it. Don't miss...read more" 5030 "2014-01-29 15:02:07" 14  https://www.zomato.com/review/zLyYR 2 1390987927.0

It is a cool place to hang out with friends over a few drinks over looking the HKV monument and lake, which is the total upside of coming to this place. The service however is probably one of the most laxed I have ever encountered, I mean we had to ask two different guys for the same thing atleast 2 times each and still it took them 30 mins to get it to us. The dimsums are just about ok (and I'm being polite here), the menu is a mix of all cuisines (mexican, indian, lebanese, mediterranean), so it seems like their team of chef's know all these, but not quite, atleast not flavour wise, I've had better of each of these in other places.

Parking in this area is a nightmare, especially during weekends.The place is almost towards the end of the main road leading into HKV; once located, we had to take the stairs since the lift wasn't working...was fine, since we had to go just a couple of flights up. Once inside, the ambiance is surprisingly quite welcoming. They have a semi open space which over looks the monument and from one angle a portion of the pond as well. I quite liked this. The downer for me was the slack service and the bland starters. It's a nice place if you want to hang around with friends over a few beers and munchies. I wouldn't really go here on a date though.

It gets really crowded specially on the weekends in the evening (just like most of the places in HKV). If the weather demands, grab a place on the roof top its huge and well lay out! The view is one of the best that any restaurant in HKV offers.  The food is good specially the Chicken shwarmas!

While it's a nice place to hang out, the prices that they charge are much too high and they could gain a lot more fan following if they drop them down a notch. It was a Friday night and it was quite packed. They have outdoor seating, that I suspect would be very pleasant in the winters. Their food is OK. Nothing to be proud of.

They put their posters in washrooms of some other cafes too so that it is hard to ignore what the cafe is about.

Wooden chairs without cushions and Cushioned settees without a back-rest! Oops. That's a problem since one goes to such a cafe to spend a certain number of hours and if the furniture doesn't allow you that then all your money spent goes down the drain.The food...well, thumbs up! I have to give them that. There's a lot to choose from, in the menu. On the expensive side, yes.

The much advised place from my friends in HKV. I must say that the experience was really nice. It is easy to find this place in Hauz Khas Village. What I liked about them is the various seating options available at the restaurant which includes the Lake facing seating as well.What I really found painful was climbing up many floors to finalize a corner to sit. Also the place was pretty full even at early in the evening of Saturday.Ambiance: This place had its own wooden and rustic charm. I like the liberal use of coir rope on lamps and wall; though very sheek. Music was good and easy on ears. Chairs were comfortable and cover size was spacious enough.

On one hand there is nothing wrong with that intent but the management shouldn't just let everybody in even though they are running 1.5 times of their capacity. Literally there were people around and sometime they seemed above your shoulders too.What this results in?

Next thing you notice is the dark ambience when you walk in. The music is very often way too loud for any conversation, which makes this place a perfect location for people who are not interesting or interested in getting to have conversations.The menu is so typical in the sense that it's multi-cuisine but doesn't master any ONE particular cuisine well. In fact, most of the food is not edible there unless you are absolutely drunk and just need to fill your stomach. This seems to be the place for people who are not there to appreciate food, but to just to have beers and be seen with the crowd." 5030 "2013-02-25 22:21:14" 12 Poor https://www.zomato.com/review/xRaGl 2 1361811074.0

Nice looking place, but with quite a climb to reach there. The food was really nice, but the service was terrible!We ordered sangrias from the menu (which took a while to come). When they came, all except one was gotten because that particular flavour was unavailable. Logically, as soon as the waiter comes to know it's unavailable should the customer be informed. So we all waited for the remaining drink to be gotten. After taking the maincourse orders ( which again took a while) the two dishes ordered by my friends were brought and my dish (pasta arrabiata) was wrongly reffered to as a 'burrito' and the server said that it was 'unavailable'.

They are extremely well shaken. And trust me when I say that their LIIT is one of the best I have had till date.

On a saturday night, you will spot more people standing and socializing, rather than comfortably seated. Most of the dishes of the menu are good, the staff is attentive, provided you have given some ""attention"" to their pockets early on in to the evening. You will then face absolutely NO problem  in getting your order placed and processed quickly even over a crowded bar on a saturday night.The sheesha used to be good, till they were serving. They do know how to serve a Ciroc without destroying it with lemonade.

But a little more appreciation wouldnt be undeserving. Kudos to the owner who chose a location that ensures maximum visibility. And the rest of the team handling the interiors, food, music etc. have done a super job which shows by the crowd streaming in at all hours. The three of us chose to sit close to the bar, which is a nice, almost private, a little dark corner. The vodka drinks and beers we usually order are quite basic so cant give much on that front. But the food is worth it. Their Chicken 65 is my absolute favorite. So much so that I order it on each trip and sometimes I even repeat on a single trip! The balcony area is decently cooled with those fans and has a good enough view for its location. Its the kinda place you gang up and go to because youve grown out of the TCs and Route04s of the city.

To start with, the menu card, alone, was a delight. Page after page of delicious sounding food from at least six or seven different countries immediately aroused the not-very-dormant foodie in me. The ambience, too, was a delight- right from the rustic wooden furniture to the giant projector screen. Ergo, it was with very high hopes that we placed our order.The first item was somewhat of a disappointment. In want of a birthday cake, we'd ordered Chocolate Banoffee Pies. A considerable mention here: in the display case where all the desserts were kept, there had been a very irritating blunder. All the pastries had been wrongly identified; Tiramisu was chocolate cake, Strawberry Cheesecake was Tiramisu. It seemed that the staff did not know their desserts. Anyway, we hadn't given up hope.

Decor is easy on the eyes and the indoors-outdoors theme really works well, specially in the awesome Delhi winters!!Prices however are a little steeper than what you would expect but the service is pretty good and servers are attentive to your needs.One point though, you guys need to figure out a system to let people switch tables and carry tabs with them. Tables arent big enough to accommodate more than 5-6 people and it keeps one person waiting for the check before switching tables." 5030 "2012-06-15 17:08:00" 23 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/aZZmo 1 1339760280.0

And they have the audacity to automatically levy a 10% service charge. That too for a drink I got myself at the bar. No waiter, nothing, just me ordering from the bartender.I ordered a large vodka. Vodka was listed at 300. I got a bill for 900! 50% overhead on tax, VAT, etc? They refused to give me a bill, till I asked for the manager. After 20 minutes they got me a bill for Rs. 855 or something, and that included 10% service charge. That too, with very poor service.Any half decent place will waive the service charge if you're not happy with the service, but these guys live in a world of their own. The money is not the issue, but their attitude and sense of entitlement of taking 10% tip without even asking if you were happy with their service (which no-one was).Go to Boheme for a better experience.

The staff are very pleasant and the manager is exceptional in his work - very prompt and cordial. The food is certainly very diverse and it's presented in a fun menu. I had their jamaican jerk chicken and it was sooo good! The drinks menu is pretty good too but for a teetotaller like me I won't delve into that.

They made us wait on the second floor for 20 minutes before we just happened to go down to the first floor and see that half the tables there were free.The first round of lunch order took 45 minutes to arrive (not for all dishes). Waiters kept coming up to our table with the wrong order. Half an hour after we placed our order, the waiter came up to us asking for our order again. Said he was ""just confirming"".When we asked for more coke for our drinks, the waiter put a half empty  500 ml pet bottle of Pepsi on our table.The worst, perhaps, was when they took over an hour to get a simple plate of dimsums.

The whole concept of the wooden interiors gives a very warm feel and the open area with the evening wind is usually great.But last i went was 14th march with Hari and Sukhmani performing which I'd mark as not a very good experience, as it was over - crowded, a lot of drinks, glasses, bottles on the floor which is not a usual there.The sound system wasn't good neither were the effects.

Food is good (actually some dishes like Penne Arrabiata and Falafel are really good). So, net-net, the food is good, decor is good but why a 'three star' rating - it's because the service is extremely slow and bad.

Third time another waiter came over and brought a pad and he finally wrote down our order. We then waited for over 30min for our food. We ordered Veg Quesadillas and Veg Empanadas. Anyone who has had these dishes in other countries or restaurants knows that they are quite different. However, here they seem to use the same filling in both which is a bad mixture of paneer, bell peppers (capsicum), re fried beans and miniscule amount of cheese. To make things worse the quesadillas tortilla was overcooked so instead of being soft it was hard  like papad. The emapanadas were just horrible, the pastry dough used to wrap the empandas was similar to what halwais use to make gujia and even looked like them.

They serve limited variety of beers and scotch.

The next feeling is a pleasant surprise as this place is not a pseudo fashionable mood-lit bar, but more of a huge living space, seeming made entirely out of raw wood. The effect is awesome. Next, I suggest you climb up the stairs and head straight outside to take in the beautiful view of the lake and monuments near hauz khas.
