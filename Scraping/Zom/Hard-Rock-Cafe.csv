This is what I came for and I was not disappointed at all. It was very very good.Friend #1 ordered the hickory BBQ burger. He enjoyed his burger as much as I did.Friend #2 is a vegetarian and ordered penne arrabiata with cottage cheese. It was awful! One of the worst I have ever tasted. Overflowing with vegetables which were cut so big. On asking the waiter a couple of times, we were given a standard answer that this is how Hard Rock serves their pasta world over.Ambience is great.

Spacious, plays sufficiently Loud music, can get pretty crowded in weekends. The food: Jumbo starter combo: huge amount of food! The spring rolls (veg), the baked potato with bacon bits are amazing. (4/5) The legendary burger: huge burger. Taking the first bite is damn difficult job. Get your meat cooked medium ( if medium rare is too raw for you). That's the best way to have it! (5/5) Tenderloin steak: good steak. Amazing quantity like all the food Hard Rock serves. Have it medium! There's definite room for improvement! (3.5/5) I love their Greek salad as well. Yum!

I still remember how my boyfriend was very excited about his HRC Paris T-shirt and he wouldn't let me discard it! That's the whole hype about HRC!Go there! Enjoy the ambience! And your tummy will never regret coming here, even if it at times might burn a whole in your pocket (though not always!).:-)" 2788 "2013-09-19 15:43:03" 3 Good https://www.zomato.com/review/AgNKB 1 1379585583.0

Its one of those must visit places when I am in town both for the food and ambiance not to mention good music !!!! The not to miss starters are the Hard Rock Nachos and the Non - Veg Jumbo Combo .... both are a super way to start your evening along with your drinks .... I love to go in a group because everyone seems chilled out once they enter this place and conversation and fun times flow. For the mains try the Legendary 10oz. Burger which is very good but unless your really hungry I would recommend you share it ...... the Smokehouse items are great especially the Bar-b-que Combo IS really good as is the Fillet Steak.

This restaurant is not so much for the college or twenties-thirties crowd as it is for the 'ultra-hip-hop', energetic high schoolers who are of the American rock generation. They enjoy loud music, food that one sees all the 'happening kids'on American TV sitcoms eating, and conversations about gadgets, phones, boyfriends/girlfriends and Facebook. The atmosphere will make them happy, and someone who is at heart always 16, even more happy!The pictures of rock stars and bands add to the ambience, which consciously seems to target young people who would dance along to this music in pubs and discos. In my personal opinion, it is slightly overt and overdone. If one wants a rock, GnR kind of look, it could also be a little more subtle than this.

The attendants were polite and one of them showed us the right table we were asking for, a bit secluded from the crowd in a corner. They arranged that for us in no time. We started with beers - Corona and the trademark non-veg platter that I like to order while @ HRC. The drinks were served instantly while to food took some 10 mins before it was in our table.

We were group of 6 and visited HRC at around 8 pm. At that point of time crowd was not that good but after an hour or so place started filling up. We ordered Mojito pitchers (one kiwi and orange) with one veg and another non-veg starter. Mojitos and veg starter (potato skin) were okay types but non-veg starter (nachos) was amazing. We also ordered one of their burgers with fries and it was one of the biggest and best burger I ever had till date. We also tried some of their whiskeys, they have a nice collection of offerings in whiskeys but when it comes to beer, both thumbs down; only kingfisher was there and that too only premium and ultra. Band performance started at around 10:30 when it was our time to leave, but we stayed for their 2-3 performances, it wasn't that great, so we decided to leave.

We found the sound level comfortable, and conversation was easy.We ordered side salads, two gurgers, and a pulled chicken sandwich.  It's always iffy in Delhi to order Caesar salad, as the dressing is either overly bland, or overly fishy.  Hard Rock's Caesar was just right.  The blue cheese dressing for the other salads tasted house-made, with nice chunks of blue cheese. The greens were fresh and crunchy.  I think next time I'll get one of their entree salads.The burgers were cooked exactly as ordered, to medium, and topped as described in the menu.  The pulled chicken had the right amount of sauce, and came with a side of coleslaw and beans.Service was friendly, attentive and accurate, and the manager checked in with each table.

Overall good although the mojitos were fairly watered down and the hummus platter was unappetising and lacked olive oil, toasted pita(which looked too spongy) and much allure. The saving grave in the meal was the 10 oz burger. Although the menu signifies it as a tenderloin steak, but was a tenderloin patty.

Rest assured _ it's the show stealer. But if the headbanging and musical jugglary fail to whet your gastronomic apetite, the cafe has added some Mexican flavours to its highlights this season. And thankfully, samosette, tacos, burritos, tostada and quesadillas blend perfectly with the cafe's awesome lilting notes.The high on chicken, beef and cheese preparations menu has an assortment of 11 items to choose from. Vegetarians may feel left out with just three veg dishes (one starter and two main-course) and may have to ask for vegetarian options since they don't show up on the menu. I started with the 'Spicy Mexican Corn and Cheddar Cheese Samosette', which became an instant favourite for its spicy tangy-dip and the oozing taste of cheese and sweet corn in crispy phyllo parcels was balanced well with the 'tacos' in the cottage cheese and grilled chicken variant.

My opinions will definitely reflect differently than someone from India who did not grow up around Western food. It may not be fair for me to judge, but honestly their hamburgers are a complete fail. They do not understand how to properly cook the meat. I do not blame them for not using beef in Delhi. I respect the cultural reasons for this. But the fact of the matter is buffalo is not an acceptable substitute for beef. In general, even at other Hard Rocks in India, the meat (beef or buffalo) is invariably seriously overcooked. Because they are huge patties, you end up with this dry, chewy, awful experience. The sheer amount of meat overwhelms any of the toppings or sauces on the burger.

As soon as you enter the place, the ambience and the loud music make you go, 'now that's awesome !!' I have been to Hard Rock a number of times, and every time i get exactly the same feel !!They have an extensive menu for food as well as drinks, and trust me, every item on their menu is worth a try. Although, you might find the prices to be slightly on the higher side, but its still worth it ! I would recommend their Herb Chicken Breast which I have every time Iam there, and still keep craving for more. Its one of my personal favourites! And yeah, before I forget to mention, don't miss out on their mouth watering Onion Rings!As far as the drinks are concerned, I am only and only a Beer lover, so i can't really comment on what to try and what not to. But looking at the menu, I would say they do have a lot of variety.All in all, its always a great experience going to Hard...read more" 2788 "2011-06-21 14:02:38" 1  https://www.zomato.com/review/zrdL 1 1308645158.0

We were charged Rs. 500 per head (Cheap!) as entry fee, and were also provided with food/drink coupons of equivalent value. Inside there was Faridkot, playing some of their most famous songs at a mind numbing volume. We grabbed a beer each and just stood there head-banging, swaying, cheering, and what not.In HRC, everything is 'cool'. You had memorabilia from world renowned musicians lining the walls, a very friendly and chilled out staff, and a rocking band followed by a rocking DJ. The right hand side of the menu was not very digestible, but we went for the Nachos priced at 450 odd rupees and were delighted by the quantity. The 4 of us were filled to the brim by the time they were finished, and after a quick smoke in the smoking lounge, we left, extremely...read more" 2788 "2011-06-18 20:05:43" 1  https://www.zomato.com/review/dZbG 3 1308407743.0

I have never had beef in a better form than that. So I am also warning that it has beef.The only thing that you might not like about it is that it is pretty expensive. You can say extraordinarily expensive. But I'd still love to go again - just for The Legendary Burger! :D" 2788 "2011-06-15 13:23:03" 12 Legendary https://www.zomato.com/review/MLpk  1308124383.0

The name itself suggests the ambience. The staff is courteous and patient. Food i would say is good nothing exceptional but the prices are on a higher side. We had few drinks and starters incl Jumbo combo and Tupelo Chicken Tenders. The bill was around 8000/.Would suggest to go in a  group if you want to economize the cost." 2788 "2011-06-01 15:11:09" 27 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/renO 1 1306921269.0

HRC, New Delhi joins its brethren across the country - Mumbai, Bangalore, Pune, Hyderabad airport etc.If you've been to one HRC then I don't really need to describe the place. As an insider told me, HRC is all about the 5 M's : Menu, Music, Memorabilia, Merchandise and Monument. Short of ego they're not. It's large, with a seating for 187 + 13 (at the bar), a separate smoking zone, a one step up stage, for the live acts (coming soon), a long bar down the side (and one more service bar coming up). Barely open a week, it's already doing average daily sales of Rs. 5 lakh and reaching a mind numbing 9.5 lakh+ on the first Saturday they were open.Read the complete review on Tulleeho!" 2788 "2011-01-05 12:19:02" 82 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/Xepl  1294210142.0
