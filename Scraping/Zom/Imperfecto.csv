So I thought of writing about something the hoity-toity lot tends to turn a blind eye to. While the aesthetics of the place couldn't get any better on the one hand, the service couldn't get worse on the other. The whole concept of eating out is to surrender to the flavors and not care about the rest, like the Exotic Vegetarian Pizza or the Broccoli Gratin we ordered. But that becomes just a tad bit difficult when it takes at least 25 minutes for each dish to be prepared, when the extra portion of garlic bread you ordered for that Lasagna arrives only once the dish is over (or becomes cold), when you have to request every now and then to refill your water glasses and above all, when there's no manager in the house to come to your rescue. While the portions are unsatisfactory, one has to admit that the food is savory and leaves you wanting just a little bit (read - A LOT) more!" 301442 "2014-08-31 18:09:01" 4 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/rnnpkm 1 1409488741.0

In other words, a hipster's paradise. What I loved especially was the outdoor seating area: quaint and beautiful, with white lawn chairs on a grassy patch that overlooks Hauz Khas, and tucked away from the rest of the city by high walls and tall trees. Perfect for a date!What we had:The chicken crepes with red wine sauce (the sauce was delicious, the crepes were average);The potato bravas (tangy spiced potatoes with olive oil and garlic sauce: nice);The grilled tenderloin pork (which was good)I liked the food, but my friend was unimpressed.

The food was very yumm!! We ordered a thin crust pizza, grilled shrimps, strawberry shake and mojito! Pizza was extremely mouth-watering! Grilled shrimps was also good. Strawberry shake was amazingly awesome and mojito sooooo refreshing! What added to its charm was the music. It is also very easy to find.

It's slightly on the expensive side, if you're having drinks as well. But the place is worth it.Ambience: It's an extremely pretty cafe with posters, books, music instruments and even typewriters used for decoration in the most creative ways. A little stream runs around the cafe with pretty foot-bridges to cross over. It's has been nicely and in a colourful way.

I have loved the sangria's here, though my only complaint is that it is too over filed with fruit. Both the red wine and the white wine variant are fabulous. My dinner companion kept it simple with a few beers. We ordered for 1 appetizer - the mix non veg plate. I loved the garlic prawns on it. It was flavorful and the prawns were perfectly done up.

Even the upstairs seating is comfy and cheery, with an adjacent balcony for smokers.What's not so amazing is probably everything else.

To begin with, I think this cafe should have been called ""Imperfectus""comes from the Latin word, meaning IMPERFECT!!! My first visit to Imperfecto at Hauz Khas village and I guess it will be the last one!We went there on a Friday night, so you'd expect it to be crowded.. We got a table right at the corner with absolutely no lights around. Anyway, asked the waiter for a torch so that I could at least read the menu...the torch arrives after a couple of minutes! We ordered a drink each (we were two of us) and a veg platter starter.. The platter arrives in 40 minutes!!! We kept waiting for the order, called the waiter a zillion times (since no one out there is responsive). Either they are deaf or I think they SERIOUSLY need some training! 40 minutes for a starter???? Anyway, we were fuming and decided to pay for the two drinks and leave.

I went to Imperfecto last week with my friends (A huge party of 10) and somehow managed to get a table (Downstairs though, you will have to wait a bit for the roof on the Saturdays). The moment I entered, I fell in love with the place just because of the music. The place gives a funky vibe. The sitting arrangement was comfy. We ordered some pizzas and pastas and out of all, the Pesto sauce Pasta is highly recommended. However, they take ""more time than what should be taken"" to deliver the food so I would recommend to go with a group coz dates can get a pretty weird turn in all that time. One more thing, they didn't allow my friend (A professional photographer) to take photos with his DSLR and made him delete the pics he took." 301442 "2014-05-24 03:10:44" 7 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/REoMD  1400881244.0

Make sure you take a walk through all the floors especially the top terrace. It gets packed so get there before 9 for a good table and if you have a group then definitely go early...don't know if they take reservations.Why not a 5?While the food is good (particularly their nonveg pizzas) its nothing to really go on about.

There is a small bridge over a narrow water-body which is though very tiny but gives a great feel to the place.

Went there for drinks with a couple of friends and sat on the terrace which was lovely. The service is pretty bad and food average. It was cold in the evening and we asked the server to put the heater on- after reminding him about 10-12 times, and waiting for 1.5 hours we finally went inside, which was equally cold. For the 3 hours we were there, we received extremely gruff service, and in a pleasant place like that you would like your server to be pleasant if not serve you with a smile. We ordered a pizza and a mazze platter- both were average and nothing out of the ordinary.

The artificial waterbody, the grass, the seating everything is done well. The place is spacious.

The interior designing has been done with a great aesthetic sense. Each and every piece of decor defines Imperfecto. The best part is the roof top which gives a beautiful view of the entire Haus Khaz village.We had a chance to directly interact with  Chef Nuria Rodriguez. An amazing person to speak with.

Finally when it did open, I decided to experience the entire offering of the place by inviting my friends over to Imperfecto for a treat.Here's my take on the place:-Food: 2.5/5We ordered mushroom moti, hummus with pita, burger, and a veg pizza. The hummus with pizza was delightful. The mushroom moti was bland, I put a lot of tobasco in it to adjust its taste according to my palate. In the pizza, the base was not crisp. The burger was good. I liked the plating of the dishes. The portion sizes were very small. The thing that put me off the most was when we ordered coke, there was something floating in it.Ambience: 5/5Imperfecto has perfected its ambience. I loved the way they have done up the walls.

We were lucky to go on a cool day and could enjoy the evening in the open air section of the restaurant. It's got a really nice vibe with a very welcoming staff (almost Greek in their hospitality!), good music and above all good food. We had a grilled fish (great presentation), a salad and the 'Sea and Land' ravioli (really good). Overall, a good experience. A word of caution: the restaurant is three floors up and the open air section is another flight of stairs away. But if you can make it, it's really worth the trek!" 301442 "2013-03-25 12:47:18" 1 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/NAEYe  1364195838.0
