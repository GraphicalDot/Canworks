There was a magician who did pretty good stuff to entertain us for a while. You can smoke anywhere you want. Its also not that expensive. We were 6 and ordered 2 pizzas, 2 pastas, 2 shakes, a wrap and we all got it done in 2700 bucks. Pretty reasonable for all the stuff it offered. The white sauce chicken penne pasta was delecious.

It was the readymade version which you can find at any bakery shop. Moreover pita was cold and hard, which was a major setback, as this is a basic dish, one can have and that also went all wrong.Then i thought of giving another try by ordering a pasta which is another basic dish in its preparation. The signature pink sauce paste was chosen for this test and it also failed drastically. Firstly it was not pink and secondly it was very dry.

I especially loved the dry Chilli Chicken - it was just perfect!Also, try the Berry Merry Lover smoothie is you're a non-alcoholic, or even if you drink.

Must say I went there solely based on the zomato reviews but I regret going there,compared to all the better choices Hauz khas village has to offer.

Never thought of the indoor seating because it was too tiny and claustrophobic.We ordered lemon chicken as a starter,chicken breast with cheese &amp; jalapeno, chilli chicken with hakka noodles as main course and some mocktails. The food was just average.They do have a good choice of menu but nothing is authentic out there. The chicken breast was chewy and hard and the noodles were very average.

Honestly the expectations were really very high as we heard a lot about this place.This restaurant is spread on a few floors and includes a open terrace seating as well. The ambiance is 'Pink' enough to attract you especially the nicely done metal buckets as chandelier.Ambiance: Lighting is dim and pink and the place score a 3 out of 5 for ambiance. Music is very loud so please don't expect a comfortable long conversation because after some time you end up shouting.Food: We ordered Thai, Italian and Lebanese food along with ice teas and shakes for beverages.The portion size seems inversely proportionate to the price. Also the food wasn't as tasty as were expecting out of the place. Food scores a 3.5 out of 5.Service: Efficient and nice. They are warm and pink people.

No matter how many times you go here, you just dont seem to get bored of the ambience, music or even food. I am guessing the major reason of it being such a hit is that this place never gets out of HUKKA. Even in the times when every other outlet has got it down due to license issues or whatever else, The pink room will still be serving it. So yea, most of the hukka lovers tend to end up at this place.Just as the name suggests, the theme of the place is quite pink. The only improvement that I could suggest for this place is that the area around its dj console should be a little more wider in terms of space. So that people could at least shake a foot or two. Everything else falls into place. Even when I dont plan it, I find myself opting to sit at the pink room.

In food the main course was so so which included (butter chicken, shahi paneer, dal makhani, noodles and chicken in black bean sauce).The startes were just about decent with chilli fish being better than rest.The place wasnt too interesting in anyway.

In a short while, my friends joined me at the terrace and since it was a warm sunny day in Delhi winters, we enjoyed the sun.

I'm a snob when it comes to music and have an inherent habit of judging people and places based on their music choice, Pink Room didn't win my heart. Loud music is indeed an attribute pertaining to a lounge but restaurants should maintain their music volume to a level where people can have a conversation. We requested one of the waiters to reduce the volume to which he gave us an explanation about speakers' placement and told us we would need to part with our balcony table and get one inside instead, of course we didn't.

Obviously,that was for good but what surprised me was that they didn't have anything in the menu that had cottage cheese. Surprising because when we ordered quesadillas,it had cottage cheese.I'm pretty sure it did.Now for the sheesha which was amazing but then came the desserts. Again,only 2 or 3 desserts were available out of the ones that were mentioned in the menu. That turned us off.So,we ordered a blueberry cheesecake,which i must say was amazing.So,the only reason i'd think of taking away points from this place is because of my weird experience of not getting anything related to cottage cheese." 9354 "2012-11-06 00:57:16" 3 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/XnGKB  1352143636.0

Smoothies and Shakes were almost addictive and reminded me of The Big Chill Cafe in some ways.The service was rather disappointing. There were three waiters on the terrace where we were sitting and sadly only one was taking orders from four tables that were occupied... Rest of the waiters didn't budge even when called for!So, here's my quick verdict on this one -Ambiance - 8/10 (Very pink and nice)Food - 7.5/10Choice of food - 8.5/10Portion of the dishes - 7/10Service - 4/10Choice of desserts - 8/10Rates - The rates are neither too steep nor too low...

The experience was the perfect amalgamation of late night hour and happening location that added to the charm.Walking through a gamut of cars on each side (and a stinky garbage disposal unit on one) at around midnight, Pink Room was pretty easy to spot. Thanks to signature color and flashy signboard. The rave reviews it has got on Zomato got to us and we preferred it amidst the other fancy options in the same street.The place is still to procure a liquor license, which more than explained it's zero occupancy on all 3 floors on that Friday night. We had our share of the liquor (hic) so we didn't really mind that.
