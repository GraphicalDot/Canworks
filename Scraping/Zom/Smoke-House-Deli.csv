The sausage plate was also pretty good: a mix of chicken sausages, pepperoni and a few other cold cuts, it was a pleasant surprise to see that they hadn't skimped on the portions like so many other places do.

This place is gorgeous and I wish Mumbai had a similar (ambiance wise) location of this restaurant. Food, Service, Experience is at par with their Mumbai outpost (the one in Bandra), what left me speechless was their location and ambiance.

You have to go through a really weird route. For a moment, we thought it was still under renovation because we had no idea where it was. Once you reach it, it is beautifully located right next to the lake. Being a Sunday night, it was pretty empty. The decorations were bare, but tasteful. There were candles lit on every table which gave the place a very cosy feeling.As soon as we were seated, we were handed a menu by the very helpful and sweet waiters.

One has to pass through a compact passage to reach this lake side restaurant. The view was good. The place is good with a warm ambiance. The staff is friendly and helping.

On the other hand my girlfriend, who had accompanied me to the place, really loved the Chicken peri piri. She enjoyed the whole experience, so it was a satisfying experience for me too.I think they lack in the dessert menu.

Chickpea and horseradish fritter is equaly good and more subtle. The chickpea mash is coarse, so the texture counterpoints well with the crunchy exterior that has been deep-fried. Wasabi cream adds a punch to it. SH Deli egg Chimay consists of halved hard boiled eggs in which the yolks have been 'devilled' with mustard and cream. Each half has been batter fried.

I love this place !Many restaurants and cafes and joints have opened up in Delhi/ NCR who care less about the food, and more about other supplementary factors. The best part about this place is its food. It is not very conveniently located (backside of the main walking lane of the village), very pretty interiors and seating area giving you a very sophisticated impression, and the food is delicious. Not to forget the service, it's equally good.People who love American Diner, would also love this place for its breakfast. Typical European breakfast with amazing pancakes and cheese and mushroom omelettes. It's a delight for the sausage and bacon lovers. I've been here thrice now.

I would probably go here in groups of up to 4 people as the space can potentially get a bit cramped beyond that number.They have an outdoor and indoor sitting area. Outdoors is nice for couples and has a nice view of the lake. We decided to sit indoors to beat the Delhi heat. The interiors are well done and the chairs were especially nice and comfortable.Ordered a couple of drinks and appetizers. The drinks were generously mixed and the appetizer was pretty good, albeit a bit spicy for my taste.

The inside seating is well done, with nice murals, and seating arranged in a manner to allow customers lake view, as far as possible.

While it has everything, it lacks that extra zing that you associate with the brandname. I had had tenderloin steak which could at best be rated as ""good"". It was a Saturday night and yet there were very few options for dessert.The staff were courteous and the decor was good. The seats could have been made more comfortable. Having eaten at a couple of more smoke house delis in the country, i felt the management could do a lot to spice up the place.However, don't let my review discourage you to takeva shot.

First of all, service was really friendly and fast. You get a complimentary starter, a nice basket full of different types of warm breads. We ordered some potato wedges as a  starter. A bit oily to my taste but nicely spiced with fresh rosemary on the top. Both of us wanted to have meat so we set our eye on their tenderloin... My husband chose their tenderloin steak and got two big pieces of nicely done meat with potatoes and some asparagus. The portion was really generous!

The Hauz Khas Village houses some of the most authentic restaurants in Delhi/NCR one being Smoke House Deli.The Smoke House Deli has a European decor and the walls are painted in white. The ceiling is quite low and gives a real feel of European dining. The menu comprised of different parts namely the First Course, the Main Course, Cocktails and lastly the dessert.The first course comprised of Balsamic Beetroot +Feta salad with Guava Emulsion and 4 Tomato + Boconcini 'Caprese' with Balsamic Onion dressing. The Balsamic Beetroot and Feta cheese salad was good and the Guava emulsion would explode with flavors. As expected the Feta cheese was salty...read more" 303092 "2013-08-12 10:22:48" 263  https://www.zomato.com/review/BpkwG 7 1376283168.0

The setting is a nice mixture of casual and formal, with cool art on the walls, european (italian?) music playing at a comfortable volume.I went to work and eat yesterday, and initially I was seated on the far side from the bar. The WiFi router is in the bar and so the signal was extremely unreliable. If you're taking your laptop, best sit IN the bar or not very far from it, because phone signals are no good in this area and 3G internet might not work. That said, it was an awesome and calm place to work in. There are nice wide tables on which business and pleasure can be mixed :)Service:Waiters pay good attention to guests. There is a mix of staff who can speak very good english, up to staff that have to be spoken to in Hindi if you want to get your meaning across.

The music in this outlet was very odd. The steak here was good (though I think it was was better at Khan Market), but the chicken was absolutely brilliant. The croissant could have been better. The pizza was good too. The cheesecake was lovely and light with a delectable plum sauce. The torte was quite rich and very satisfying (I recommend you split it with someone because it is hard to eat that much chocolate all by yourself). The Creme Brulee had all the orange flavour in the caramelized sugar on top.

The oodles of space does not translate into a better experience per se.    I maybe knit picking but the stewards looked blank when I asked for suggestions, startup issues perhaps. And then there was the sacrilege of sambal overdosing some very anorexic prawn skewers, I could have closed my eyes and been eating sambal Jell-O shots.
