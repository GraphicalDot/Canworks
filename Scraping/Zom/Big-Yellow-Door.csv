Since we were a group of 'always hungry' group, were able to eat all that very easily :).The food was average. Average does not mean the food tasted bad.

So much so that despite that place being almost 20 kms from my home, I still try to visit it every fortnight :)So it was quite obvious that I was very excited to check this outlet out as soon as i got to know about it.Made a plan with 4 of my friends last weekend. Since two among them were BYD fans too, so it hardly took any convincing at all on my part for this place. The road opposite Venky; where this particular outlet is situated; is slowly but steadily looking more and more like the Hudson Lane @DU. Already half of the Hudson Lane's biggies like Qd's, Woodbox cafe and BYD have landed here and based on their humongous success, I can clearly see many other following suit pretty soon.On arrival here, we were told that the waiting time will be about 40-45mins.

But what is not little is their generosity. This place is perfect for a group of friends, who at the end of a hectic day at college, want to dive into deliciousness, without ofcourse having to give up half their monthly allowance. From shakes to burgers, BYD has the perfect menu for all kinds of food buffs. The yummy-ness of the baked nachos dish is inexplicable. The personal basket for burgers too is loaded with chips and accompanying dip for a fulfilling meal. The place in itself is a little bit disappointing merely because of the squeezed tables and chairs, lacking privacy for different parties. But that is perhaps the ambience BYD wishes to create.

Firstly, they serve you a take away (small) glass when you want water - which in itself is just such a disappointment. Worst is the food - the chicken breast piece was stale - when I told the waiter he said - it's probably the mix used and I must be mistaken. The nachos with cheese had plentiful cheese - but the sauce along with it was poorly done and over all sadly executed.

The food menu is interesting and the best part has to be their serving time. My butter chicken pizza was served in less than 10 minutes and yes, it is a must try! You also get the option of making your pizzas thin crust or cheese burst! Then came the cheesy fries which were average as the ""so called cheese"" is sour cream instead. Smoked Chicken sandwiches were grilled to perfection and tasted amazing! The quantity is huge and is the best part for the price you'd pay! And yes, don't forget to try their kitkat shake if you love chocolate. I would definitely like to give this place another visit to try out the rest of their menu items!

Really loved the place, such a cool hangout place serving such amazing food in such reasonable price and the best part is the quantity which is sufficient for for person so we could order multiple items for everyone. The sitting arrangement is wonderful if you get to seat at the low level seats.We ordered lot of things the bomb burger, the cheese chicken pasta, the napolitano pasta, chicken wings, some salad, rocky road shakes, green apple mojito, veg pizza and baked nachos. Most of the items exceeded our expectations.The only thing that I am disappointed with is the serve only chicken items :( I would expect them to add lamb, pork, buff and bacon soon that would attract a lot of hard core non veg customers and also have a better menu in place.Last but not the least, their staff are so nice so pleasant and so accommodating who makes every visit memorable." 306503 "2014-06-03 23:51:10" 5 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/lqGAO  1401819670.0

There were many people waiting ahead of us, but we weren't informed of that until we had to coax the information out of the usher, though this is something we should have been promptly notified about. Upon asking the usher for an honest answer as to how long do we have to wait this time, he plainly said ""I cannot give any approximation."" What sort of an answer is that? Is this a joke? Were we actually expected to wait outside the cafe for an indefinite period of time?!

Nachos were overloaded with cheese and were amazing. Strawberry shake was quite ordinary, nothing special about it. However, the pasta was kind of good.

I ll make this simple-The place is small but felt cozy and comfortable. Service is the same, i saw the same managers in the the other branch.The food is as usual amazing. I love the shakes, rocky road is my favorite, and the bomb burger(huge,fresh and juicy are the three words that come to mind). Dint like the tipsilicious pasta and they were kind enough to offer a replacement but since we were done with our food they made the pasta complementary. Appreciate it.If you are a foodie then you need to check this place out. Period." 306503 "2014-01-06 02:08:49" 23 "Very Good" https://www.zomato.com/review/owAOk 3 1388954329.0
