We ordered Nachos with bbq chicken and Go Veg Burger. Nachos were fine but the chicken was a bit undercooked even after we got it replaced. Burger was fine too but it didn't turn out that mouth watering delicious as we expected. Presentation was good.

I took my wife along to one of the most happening place, so called from my friends and on FB. I checked in around 9pm, it was totally overloaded and jam packed. Nevertheless, as we entered music was awesome and restaurant manager was pretty decent in welcoming us and told us openly to wait for half n hr which we surely understood as it was weekend time. Crowd, ambience and food was good, even the service. Don't miss the nachos. Something which we din't like was that we had to wait for 1.5 hrs then also we never got a table which was not acceptable be any pub lounge, this is the only reason for rating it 4.Overall it is a good place to visit but don't be dependent on the reservation for table once you enter as it is first come basis and no prior bookings are taken.

I was ignored twice, once the server walked away to talk to another guy and all of them stood in corners chatting among themselves making it very difficult to get their attention. I had to pay 10% - Rs 123 for the shitty service5) Music was bad... What were they playing?And then we saw a couple running with a kid on their arms.

We went there simply to try their signature cocktails as i had only tried their cocktails once in Bangalore and it was nice. Before I start my comments on the drinks i must say that this is definitely the ""BEST PRICED BAR"" in Delhi as regards the drinks and cocktails. Very affordable to visit the place three times a week. One of the reasons why the place was buzzing early on a tuesday evening.The first set of cocktails that we ordered were the top selling ""Manga"" and the ""Go Guava"". Manga is a vodka based drink with aam paana concentrate while the Go Guava is another vodka based cocktail with a hint of mint and spices. It was quite a disappointment in both cases. They both were extremely sweet. The problem with both drinks are that aam paana concentrate we get is already...read more" 305461 "2014-07-11 13:55:17" 2  https://www.zomato.com/review/rMQdy  1405067117.0

Located right opposite DPS Vasant Kunj, this place is not hard to miss or find.

This just makes the place even more inviting.The moment you enter, they have two floors but the ground floor is sort of divided with two levels itself.They have a pretty big space in the center with high tables laid out.

Spicey yet tender sweet pork bits.Rounded it off with the date cake and toffee and the pull bun, which was way better than the glutinous stuff you get at Cinnabon.Wish we had more room for the other stuff, but being a monkey bar fan, am definitely coming back for my steak and burger fix." 305461 "2014-07-06 14:02:40" 5 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/wevKk 3 1404635560.0

The Butterfly Chicken was actually quite good. From there on the experience became better. The laksa was nice as was the lamb burger. The tiger steak was delicious enough for me (someone who doesn't eat tenderloin regularly) to take a bite. The pork curry on the other hand was not too good. We also ordered the galouti kebabs. What was odd was that we got four pieces of bread and three kebabs.

Anyway, when I was invited to be there for the ongoing Mocktober fest, I rubbed my hands with glee.Monkey Bar, for the uninitiated, is a gastro pub in Vasant Kunj and is the brainchild of AD Singh, one of India's top restaurateurs. This is the second Monkey bar in the country, first being in Bangalore fittingly as it is India's pub capital.Now, I really need to ask the owners whether the glass dome was already present and they decided to build a restaurant inside it or if they were really inspired by Louvre. Either way it is a striking structure and looks like a restaurant from a ""galaxy far far away"".Monkey Bar is one of those restaurants whose vibe you can gauge the moment you step in.

But, the ambience was lively and amazing, the songs suited the mood of the people. Though the place is huge, the seating is very less. We were two people and the place was so crowded that we decided to have tit bits and move to some other place. We started with Sangria, Maanga, flutterfly and tiger steak.

No reservations - Insane waiting time especially on a Saturday evening3. Food quantity - The smallest of portions cut into half and divided into 3 different plates and a sliver from one of those 3. That's how small each dish's serving is. You would wonder if it's a sampler to test and order a full dish or is it just to smell it just to instagram it.

Nonetheless, we comfortably folded our legs up and sat with a pint of chilled Kingfisher Ultra.To start with the Appetizers, keeping in mind the suggested options read previously in other reviews , I'd ordered for Flutterfly (A vegetarian dish, made of deep fried butterfly- looking crisp shells filled with paneer (cottage cheese), other veggies and sauces) Though I didn't find it as great as what the reviews had suggested me but you surely wouldn't regret trying it out for once.If you're a non vegetarian, do place an order for the Bang-Bang prawns (Yes, as interesting as it sounds, tastes yum too).

The interiors otherwise are nicely done.Though we should have tried cocktails, as the place is said to be famous for it, but seeing  60ml cocktail priced at 300-400 bucks was not that appealing, given that the glass was full of ice, hence we stuck to beer.

The food is typically Gastropub style (which they claim monkey bar is), not very elaborate. It is not a place to stuff yourself with food, as you can't really eat a 3 course meal.

Calamari was scrumptious while the Jacket Potatoes (think they call it Skins or some such) were a dignified end to the pig's life laced with lots of cheese. What really blew me away was the MoBar Burger - I had read much about it but I never trust anyone's opinion of a burger tool such time I personally take a bite. It was juicy, the bread was perfect and held, while the crispy bacon on top makes a possible cardiac arrest perfectly worth it.

Yesterday was the first time i went there on a Saturday. And i realised my mistake the moment I walked in.The place was packed with more people than it could hold (it is really not that big a place). 10 mins to reach my friends who were standing at the bar. Another 20 mins to get my drink (and i ordered a simple whiskey with coke as getting a cocktail made was nearly impossible). And when I finally got my drink, the glass was smelling of bananas!

Designed originally for what seemed like a restaurant, Monkey bar caught on as the next big place to be spotted on a Friday or Saturday night, and those are the days you must avoid the place like the plague. Monkey Bar's strengths are in its food menu, which is very varied and most options to choose from will deliver par expectations. I would particularly recommend the lamb burger, devilled fish, and the chilli corn carne. There is a bar serving up the usual stuff, but the tap beer on offer is quite watered down, but the naarangi (a special cocktail) is pretty darn good. Unless the drinks are coming to your table, expect to wait 20 minutes to get a drink at the understaffed bar.

The Aam paana is something really different, something quite new with the Vodka and Aam ras combination. The Copper monkey was also quite nice. I would like to note of moment of silence in respect to the absolutely fantastic Caramelised Mobar ribs. The Mobar Hamburger is perfect for someone who wants to go for the kill.

Mint suits the hot coffee's, but there's no way it was apt for MB's cold one.We were already quite disappointed by this, but our friend had already ordered the nachos. They were such a disgust.

The ambience was unique, being inside a glass pyramid, reminded me of the louvre museum in Paris. I wonder what it would be like during the scorching heat of delhi.Anyway, we got a table in 15 minutes. so we ordered the renown whiskey cocktail and the aam panna vodka cocktail. Lived upto it's reputation! Ordered another round immediately after downing them. This was obviously accompanied by some sumptuous starters: calamiri, nachos and black pepper chicken.What I loved the most were the square bowl serving, coasters and glasses for drinks.5/5 till now.Enjoyed a hamburger which was very well done and despite the crowded place, there were no downfalls in our order.

The intriguing part of this place is the blend of 'genres' it falls into. It can be a retreat since it is surrounded by soothing greenery and the entrance lies at the end of a short but pretty walk. Its only neighbours are a couple of banks, restaurants and a school opposite. Despite the latter, one need not dread the presence of school kiddies throwing food around and binge-drinking. Monkey bar has a strict age policy and thus is usually frequented by the twenty or thirty-something crowd. This is a welcome relief from the teenagey feel of most bars around town. The parking is not too bad, although a little cramped and might be troublesome on crowded days.A haven of peace it might be, but on entering the bar, one is immediately cheered up by the liveliness of the atmosphere.

Must try!Goan chorizo pao: loved it... Soft buns and good chorizo. Could have been slightly more spicy.Tikki of joy: Bengali style fish cutlets. The mustard sauce is a great touch (all bongs would agree).The bad:Devilled fish: more like dry chilly fish. On the saltier side and a very basic dish.

Finding seating is a real bitch and the staff appears to be a bit at sea, their managers are dressed a bit like the ubiquitous college kids who are hanging around.  My recomendation is to go with a lot of their small plates, we had their Nachos which were decent, the Pork Sorpotel, Spare Ribs, Potato skins, galauti kababs and the brain cutlets.

It looks extremely swanky and fancy from the outside, which is a little dissonant with the name. Once you step inside, though, the ambience is funky and fun. There are film posters, cartoons and other fun things all over the place. Once you sit inside and try to have a conversation, though, you begin paying attention to the music, which is a little yuppie and too teenage for my tastes. It is also fairly distracting and doesn't go very well with the quirkyness of the restaurant.Now, the food. The Tiger Steak was lovely. The beef was cooked really well and the sauce it was made in was watery and spicy and delicious.

I won't say much else about it, because really you have to be there to experience it.Coming to the food, we had a 90% success rate, which I think is pretty damn good for the amount we ordered. Lets see.. we got the goan chorizo pao, the loaded nachos, the pork ribs, some sort of thai tenderloin and the parsi mutton curry. The tenderloin lacked  salt and flavor, but was not too bad otherwise. The rest of the stuff was really quite good.The service was impressive too.

So it just struck to me how great reviews I've read about this particular place in VK. Hence Monkey Bar happened. I was quite excited seeing the glass pyramid and couldn't wait to witness the glory of this place. And yes, I was not disappointed! As you enter you realize it's such a huge, open place with such a young vibe to it. Havent seen a place like this since long. Most of the cafes and lounges these days are pretty loud, and cramped up. But this place was an amazing change! we were seated on the first floor and I absoloutely fell in love with this place. Sunshine pearing in through the glass ceiling made this winter afternoon beautiful. Such a Chilled out place! The green furniture, huge tables, spaced out well, red bricks, amazing paintings hung on the wall.. the interior is done up so well!!

The other 1.5 points is solely for the food they serve. The first impression as you walk in is of the huge space. Very nice utilisation of a place which no one knew what to do with over the years. Smart service is another aspect you will encounter. Could just sample a few items on my first visit and was impressed. The version of the parsi berry pulao may not be authentic but was bang on in flavor. The burger I suspect is ordered by half the tables and for good reason. Big and meaty is the way they should be. All in all, definitely worth a few visits to go through their extensive menu." 305461 "2014-01-18 19:54:44" 37 Excellent https://www.zomato.com/review/mwMpK 4 1390055084.0

Went for lunch.,and being a working afternoon we were the only people, but the decor was funky, and loved the openness of it. Nice sunlit space, and happy people around!Since they just got their licence, their collection seems to be limited, but we shall save our next visit for some cocktail time!The food was delicious, specially the MOBAR burger and the monkey cake! that literally took the cake for us! The liver on toast could have been a bit more toasty n crunchy. but the flavors were bang on. Little mustard enhanced the liver nicely, though raw onions on top, for me could have been spared!

I had to meet someone to discuss a project, and since i live in Vasant Kunj, he suggested that we meet at the Monkey Bar. The surprising thing is that I had no idea about this place, even though it has opened 5 minutes from my house. It has come up where the 'Ministry of Sound' used to be, once upon a time!I have been to the Monkey Bar three times hence, and I have enjoyed every visit. The decor is very funky, with framed movie posters on brick walls. One of the best things about this place is the games. They have pool tables and even a Foos Ball Table right in the middle of the floor. The whole area is divided into 3 parts. When you enter, the bar(non-functional, as of now) is right in front. There is huge monkey hanging on top of it! The Foos Ball table faces the bar, and a pretty big stage can be set up where it is,in case they plan to do gigs in the future.

Just had lunch there and was blown away by how they had converted the infamous ministry of sound 'pyramid' in Vasant Kunj to an extremely well thought out and tastefully done bar.On to the food:I tried the MoBar burger - which in my mind is easily one of the best burgers in town ( the secret is that they use beef not buff , which makes the patty juicier and more tender)The pork ribs - a good way to judge ribs is how easily the meat pulls off the bone; they've got it spot on.The hearty Bowl Soup - a bar that does asian soups well?It exists! (and not the thick, gross corn flour kind that we've been made used to)Overall, a very tastefully done, fun bar you can monkey around in and enjoy great food while you're at it.

As of now, they don't have a Liquor license so half the charm of the place goes because of that. It has the potential to be a good place to have a couple of drinks, with pool and foosball table.The food seems quite reasonably priced. For starters, we ordered the Bombay Vada Pav, the potato skins and one more thing. Starters were really good and we looked forward to the famous burgers.Unfortunately, the burger did not live upto my expectations. First, it is really really big, which works against it. The bun was not good and the burger was too bready. Being a wide burger, the patty thickness did not match and the burger was not juicy enough.I would go back to this place to have a drink when they have a license." 305461 "2013-12-19 15:25:37" 18 Average https://www.zomato.com/review/zvOan 1 1387446937.0
